## Points

- Robert Lewis Dabny argued that there is no person more influential to a child than their parent.
- What is **Biblical education**? 
	- The God of the Bible must be **central** to <u>every</u> aspect of education. 
		- Not peripheral, or incidental. 
		- The most important scripture is **"In the beginning, God"**: [[Gen-01#v1|Genesis 1]] 
			- This verse is the foundation of all things.
		- God is the central, foundational subject of all things. 
- The God of the Bible is revealed most perfectly in the person of Jesus Christ
	- [[John-01#v18|John 1:18]]: *No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.*
	- [[Rom-11#v36|Romans 11:36]]: *Of Him [Jesus], through Him and to Him are all things*
		- God is, in reality, central and foundational to all reality. Therefore **to view reality, detached from God, is to be detached from reality**
- This brings us to our text: [[Prov-01#v7|Proverbs 1:7]]: *The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.*
	- Recognizing that all of our existence ought to be in subjection to the Creator, this is the beginning of knowledge. 
- What happens when we seek [[knowledge]], without God? 
	- [[Rom-01#v28|Romans 1:28]]: *And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, **God gave them over to a debased mind**, to do those things which are not fitting;* 
	- The ethics and morals of the pagan world are the outgrowth of a refusal to acknowledge God as central to everything. 
- Godly education in the family: 
	- ‚≠ê: Education begins at the lap of the father and the breast of the mother. 
	- Education must not be merely something we do at church, or once in a while. 
		- Education must be at every moment of the day. 
		- Parents must be "God-soaked", filled with God throughout their lives so that they may fill their children throughout their lives. 
- Case studies:
	- Moses was nursed by his own mother, yet raised by an Egyptian. Yet Moses left behind his Egyptian upbringing and served God instead. 
	- Daniel was forced into a pagan Babylonian context, forced to reject their own God, yet he and his friends did not waver, turning from their Godly upbringing. 
- Views on education: 
	- some argue that we should allow a child to be an independent thinker, avoiding to teach them our beliefs and values, until a child is mature enough to decide on their own. 
		- Dabny argues this is incorrect. For it is unavoidable that you will influence your child. You will either do it directly or indirectly. 
		- How you raise your children affects not only your children but their children, all the way to the end of time. 
- 1st principle: God must be absolutely central to all aspects of education. 
- 2nd principle: The rising generation should be educated in a context where the bible has ultimate authority over all education
	- God reveals Himself in all things, in nature, in [[general revelation]]:
		- [[1 Cor-11#v4|1 Corinthians 11:4]] Paul: *Doesn't nature itself teach you?* 
	- Yet God speaks specifically in Scripture, [[special revelation]]: 
		- Scripture, special revelation, has authority, above all other sources of knowledge available to mankind. 
		- We must thoroughly align our thinking with God
		- [[2 Cor-10#v3|2 Corinthians 10:3-5]]  we must **bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ**.
			- This is your task. This is biblical education
- principle 3: the rising generation must be brought up in a context in which parents embody the Gospel.
	- [[Luke-06#v39|Luke 6:39-40]]: *Can the blind lead the blind? A disciple is not above his teacher. But everyone, when he is perfectly trained, shall be as his teacher*
		- In other words, Jesus is saying that if the student truly learns from their teacher, then they will be like their teacher. 
		- This means that **the teacher must be what they want their students to become**. 
			- [[Phil-04#v9|Philippians 4:9]] : *The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.*
				- It is not enough to say: *Do as I say, not as I do.* 
				- No amount of preaching and teaching can overcome your example. 
					- We must model for our children and students what we are seeking for them to become. 
					- ‚≠ê: Note: Part of this also means admitting our failures, repenting, asking for forgiveness. We must model these things. 
				- **If your children do not see Christ validated in your home, then they will not hunger for the Christ that is preached.** 
			- Nothing hardens a child to the Gospel more than people who profess the Truth and yet do not embody it. 
- Principle 4: the rising generation must be educated in a context in which the home, school, and church is united in training up the child to fear the LORD: 
- Dabny: Christian parents teaching their children biblically, is the best means to bring the Gospel to our children. 

## Application
- Children, are you thankful for God? 
	- We are everywhere confronted with the truth of God. Are you thankful for this? You ought to be.
	- Stop being irritated at God and fighting it. 
	- Are you taking advantage of the Christian upbringing that you are being given? 
	- Or are you quietly rebelling, doing the minimal amount of work to be acceptable? 
	- You are privileged. Use your privilege for God's glory. 
- Brothers and sisters, expect God to do great things.
