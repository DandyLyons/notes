## Points

- What are some common ideas about angels today? 
	- Angels are quite popular in society today, even amongst non-Christians and people who haven't even read the Bible. 
	- Many books and movies are about angels. 
	- Although our society is fascinated with angels, the church has largely been silent on angels. 
	- Without a biblical understanding of angels, there are great dangers. We can become susceptible to the deceptions of fallen angels. 
		- Mohammad received the Quran from someone he believed and taught to be the angel Gabriel
		- Joseph Smith likewise received the Book of Mormon from a supposed angel named Moroni
		- But Paul taught us to test the angels and to be wary of false gospels from fallen angels. [[Gal-01#v8|Galatians 1:8]] 
- We must also be careful not to be overly fixated on angels. 
- Most depictions of angels in our culture are a made up product of human imagination, but these are not in line with what we see in the Bible. 
- What does the bible teach about angels? 
	- Angels are always masculine. There are no female angels in the bible
	- They can travel instantly
	- They are immaterial spirits.   [[Heb-01#v14|Hebrews 1:14]]
		- They do not have a physical body (though they have, on occasion temporarily taken a physical body)
	- They do not all have wings. Only the cherubim and seraphim
	- There's no indication that they age. 
	- They are created but they exist for all eternity
	- They are terrifyingly powerful beings[^1]. 
		- e.g. In Genesis 3, angels guard Eden with flaming swords
		- Exodus 14 says an angel held the entire army of Pharaoh at bay
		- In Revelation, the angels battle with the dragon and overcome it. 
	- Angels are creatures created by God. 
		- Not spiritually evolved humans. 
		- The bible shows no indication whatsoever that humans have or ever will become angels. 
	- [[1 Cor-06#v3|1 Corinthians 6:3]]: we humans will judge the angels
	- God sent His only Son to die for humans, not for angels. 
	- Blaise Pascal: *We are the scum and the glory of the universe.*
		- He's referring to how we are sinners in the sight of God, and yet God loved us so much that He sent His only Son to die in our place. 
	- [[1 Pet-01#v12|1 Peter 1:12]] : the angels desire to know the plans of God
	- [[Heb-01#v14|Hebrews 1:14]] : the angels are ministering (serving) spirits sent out to do service for those who will be saved. 
- Takeaways: 
	- We should have a biblical-only view of angels. Not the false view from our secular culture.
	- We should never allow angels to replace God.
		- For many people, an angel is preferable to God. We want a guardian angel, but are uninterested in God. 
			- We want a personal guardian angel who is out our beck and call. 
			- This preference for angels is an offense to God: [[Exod-20#v3|Exodus 20:3-6]]. 
				- We are told to have no other gods before Him. 
	- We must never worship angels: 
		- [[Col-02#v18|Colossians 2:18-19]] : Paul taught not to worship angels. 
		- [[Rev-19#v9|Revelation 19:9-10]] : John worshipped an angel, yet the angel refused him and told John to direct his worship to God. 
		- We were never told to pray to angels. 
- In our text we see some ways that angels are ministers: 
	- [[Ps-34#v7|Psalm 34:7]]: God's angel protects and delivers those who fear God. 
	- Are there examples of angels serving in the bible? Yes:
		- In Daniel 3, the men refused to worship an idol. They were condemned to death but an angel saved them. 
		- In Daniel 6, Daniel was thrown into the Lion's den but God sent an angel to shut the mouths of the lions. 
		- [[Acts-12#v5|Acts 12:5-7]] : God sent an angel to bust Paul out of prison. 
		- Elisha and his servant were also delivered thanks to angels. 
		- [[Ps-91#v11|Psalm 91:11]]: 
		- Angels also give guidance and messages from God. 
			- The word angel in Hebrew actually means messenger. They deliver messages from God. 
			- [[Gen-16#v7|Genesis 16:7-9]]: God sent a message to Hagar
			- [[Gen-19#v16|Genesis 19:16-19]] God sent angels to Lot in Sodom, to warn them of the coming danger 
			- The angels sent the message that God would send the judge Samson in Judges 13. 
			- Angels appeared many times with many messages in the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus. 
				- the angels even ministered to Jesus when he was recovering from his temptation in the dessert. (Matthew 4). 
			- both Stephen and Paul say that the word was given to us by the ministry of angels. 
				- [[Acts-07#v53|Acts 7:53]] 
				- [[Gal-03#v19|Galatians 3:19]]
				- [[Heb-02#v2|Hebrews 2:2]] 
		- Angels also provide comfort, strength, and encouragement
			- Elijah fled persecution from Jezebel
			- [[Dan-10#v18|Daniel 10:18-19]]  
			- [[Heb-01#v14|Hebrews 1:14]]: *the angels are ministering spirits*
		- Angels also serve as God's ministers of judgment: 
			- God used angels to scatter the people of Israel, Babylon, Nineveh
			- to kill the first born in Egypt
			- Acts 12 shows us that an angel smote Herod with worms
		- The angels derive their power and authority from God.
			- Apart from God they can do nothing. 
- In Psalm 103: 
	- God commands the angels to worship Him.

## Application
- When we learn about angels in the bible then we learn far more about God. 
	- It teaches us that God is **actively** involved in this world. 
		- God did not make this world and leave it and forget it
		- [[Col-01#v17|Colossians 1:17]] God holds all things together. The world could continue without, but it could not go on without God. 
	- He is to be worshipped by all men and all angels. 
		- Many people do not bless the LORD, nor worship God. 
		- We cannot worship God without the work of Christ.
