## Points

- We are all crumbling. Yet there are 2 supports that the LORD gives us: 
	- the pity of the LORD. 
	- the [[mercy]] of the LORD
- Today we learn about the mercy of God
	- the mercy of the LORD is everlasting. It extends to not only us, but our children, and our children's children. 
	- We all need God's mercy? Why? 
		- Perhaps, the Holy Spirit convicts you, showing the parts of your life that are not right. With your marriage, and your kids. You see the judgment of God and yet you can come to Him for mercy. 
			- [[Luke-01#v72|Luke 1:72-79]]: Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist prophesied John's life and mission. John would prepare the way for Christ. Why? 
				- *to show <u>mercy</u> toward our fathers*
					- We often worry about death. Parent's worry about the death of their children. And we think *how shall we withstand the judgment and wrath of God?*. Psalm 103 answer: 
						- *But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear Him, His righteousness to children's children*
						- He not only saves us but our children. This is the hope that God gives to parents: **the promise of mercy from God to our children**
- Also, we see here, that the LORD wants to teach you and to change you even through many generations. 
	- Baptism also speaks to this. 
		- Both baptism and the mercy of the LORD show the promise of Christ to cleanse us of all our sins and defilement. 
	- ‚ùì: Do you also see *your* need for the mercy of the LORD? 
- The third aspect of hope that the LORD gives to parents is that <u>the LORD wants to apply His mercy to you, your children, and your children's children</u>. 
	- Do you ever think or wonder about your children: 
		- *What will they be like as teenagers?*
		- *What will they do after I pass? Or what will their children be like?* 
	- God answers: 
		- Come to me. You may plead to me, and cling to me for my mercy. 
- Fear of the LORD: 
	- What does it mean to fear the LORD? 
		- We live in a time where churches say *fear of the LORD is only for the OT. But we're a NT church.*
			- This is a misunderstanding and a poor teaching. 
		- The fear of the LORD is <u>not fright</u>, but it is a childlike fear. It is reverence for the LORD. 
			- [[Phil-02#v12|Philippians 2:12-13]] 
			- We should teach our children to fear the LORD. 
			- ‚ùì: Do you and I fear Him, revere Him, and cling to Him? 
- The mercy of the LORD is a wonderful thing. 
	- It is not just for believers, but also for sinners outside of the church who do not yet know their need for God's mercy. 
	- <u>If you learn to fear the LORD, then you also learn to keep His covenant.</u>. 
		- We must nurture the bond of our covenant with God. 
			- Just like how we must nurture the covenant of our marriage. Many foolishly think that once we are married we have it made, but no, a marriage must be nurtured. 
				- ‚ùì: Husbands, when was the last time that you thanked your wife? 
		- How do we nurture our bond with God? We do it with <u>prayer</u>.
			- Put to death your former self and sins. Repent. 
			- Confess your sins to Him. 
			- Sing a song of praise to the LORD. 
			- Read the scriptures, personally, and as a family.
