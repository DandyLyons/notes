## Points

- Paul continues to defend himself and his ministry from the false accusations of the false apostles. 
- It is not a new thing for true teachers to be criticized by false teachers. 
	- This will continue to happen as long as Satan is at work in this world. 
	- Therefore do not think that a teacher is wrong or in error simply because they are accused by others. 
- [[boasting]]:
	- the more worthy we are, the even less we should boast. 
	- it is dangerous to boast because: 
		- Boasting leads to foolishness
		- Boasting causes others to think more of us, [[2 Cor-12#v6|2 Corinthians 12:6]] 
		- It is not profitable [[2 Cor-12#v1|2 Corinthians 12:1]]
	- Therefore all Christians should avoid boasting
	- However there are times when it is good and necessary for us to boast
		- When it is necessary to defend Christ's and our honor
- Paul shares an account of a man who was *caught up into the third heaven*: 
	- Who is this man? 
		- Allison: Paul is referring to himself, in the third person, in order to hesitantly boast in a way as humble as possible. 
	- What is the *third heaven*? 
		- We don't necessarily know what the third heaven is, but it certainly implies that this person not only went up to heaven but went to a higher more significant heaven. 
		- What is the first and second heaven? 
	- What is [[Paradise]]? 
		- The Garden of Eden is called Paradise in the bible. .
		- [[Luke-23#v42|Luke 23:42-43]]: Jesus promised the thief on the cross that he would be with Jesus in Paradise. 
		- Paradise is: 
			- [[Abraham's bosom]] 
			- It is what Lazarus saw
			- It is what Jesus saw on the cross. 
			- It is where Adam and Eve lived. 
- Inexpressible words
	- These words cannot be uttered [by mere men]
	- Also, it is unlawful for man to utter these words. 
	- God has revealed to us, and revealed sufficiently
		- [[Deut-29#v29|Deuteronomy 29:29]] *the secret things belong to God, but the revealed things belong to us* 
			- We cannot speak to the things that God has not revealed to us. We can only speak to the things that God **has** revealed to us. 
				- And He truly has revealed so much to us through the Word, and Christ, and the Prophets
	- When God does bring us home to glory, He will reveal to us all that we need to know in order to love and praise Him forever. 
- Paul boasts unwillingly, [[2 Cor-12#v5|2 Corinthians 12:5-6]]
	- Most of us spend our lives doing everything we can to make others think **more** of us
	- Yet here Paul endeavors so that others will think **less** of him. 
		- Paul doesn't want to receive more glory than he deserves and therefore he avoids boasting. 
		- But Paul also doesn't want to receive **less** glory than he deserves and therefore he does boast, but only when it is necessary. 
			- And in fact Paul boasts of his weaknesses: [[2 Cor-12#v9|2 Corinthians 12:9]]
