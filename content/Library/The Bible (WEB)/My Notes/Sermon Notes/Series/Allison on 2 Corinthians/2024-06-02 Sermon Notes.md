## Points

- Paul went out of his way to make sure that the Corinthians could receive the Gospel at no cost. 
	- He had a right to accept a salary for his labor yet chose not to. 
	- This offended the Corinthians that he would not receive a salary. 
		- If a speaker speaks for free then typically this means that their message is worthless. That their speaking is not valuable. 
		- They were also offended that Paul was supported financially by the Macedonians and yet would not accept payment from the Corinthians. 
- God is teaching us in this passage that we ought to make sure that others know that when we share the Gospel, they may receive it free of charge. 
	- [[Isa-55#v1|Isaiah 55:1-3]] 
	- [[Rom-05#v15|Romans 5:15-21]] 
		- The Gospel is a **free gift**. 
	- [[Rom-06#v23|Romans 6:23]] 
	- [[Ephes-01#v7|Ephesians 1:7]] 
	- [[Ephes-02#v8|Ephesians 2:8-11]] 
	- Takeaway: God saves free of charge. 
		- You cannot buy salvation, nor buy His favor or love.
	- We should not exploit the Gospel for means of personal gain or benefit. 
		- [[Titus-01#v7|Titus 1:7]]
		- The Gospel is not about us. It is about Christ. 
- Paul chose to preach the Gospel free of charge, even despite opposition from others. 
	- [[2 Cor-11#v10|2 Corinthians 11:10]]
		- *As the truth of Christ is in me*: This is a bold statement. 
			- Similar to what Jesus said in [[John-04#v14|John 4:14]]. 
				- Jesus is claiming that He Himself transforms us sinners from the inside out. *Christ is living water and life.*
			- [[John-07#v37|John 7:37]] 
			- [[John-14#v17|John 14:17]] *The Holy Spirit will live <u>in</u> you.*
			- [[John-14#v6|John 14:6]] When Jesus is in you, then the **truth** of Christ is in you. 
				- It fills all your life, mind, and very existence. 
				- You will face opposition, but Christ who is in you, is greater than the world. He will overcome the opposition. Trust Him. 
			- Paul had integrity and sincerity. He renounced hypocrisy. He was true. 
				- He not only spoke the truth, but he lived out the truth. 
- [[2 Cor-11#v11|2 Corinthians 11:11]]
	- *Why? Because I don't love you? God knows.*
		- The false teachers taught that Paul did these things because he didn't love the Corinthians. But actually it was **because he did love them**. 
			- Paul recounts the many sufferings that he endured **for** the corinthians in ch. 6 and 7. 
			- Paul loves lost sinners and wants them to receive salvation. 
		- What does *God knows* mean? 
			- *God knows that I (Paul) love you!*
	- False teachers regularly accuse true teachers of being unloving. 
		- This is what Paul faced in Corinth. But while he may have been slandered, Paul knew that *God knows*, and that is the only opinion that truly matters. 
	- ‚ùì: Do you and I truly love sinners? 
		- Do we **freely** offer Christ?
