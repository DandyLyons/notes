## Points

- What is the first thing we see about these cults? 
	- At this time in Corinth, some sort of new sect was developing. 
		- They were known for their boasting. Boasting was mentioned 4 times in the text. 
		- It is likely that they claimed to have received special knowledge from God, and then boasted about it. 
		- This sect appears to have been developing into a cult
	- Throughout history, many cults were founded by people who actually grew up in the Church: 
		- Jim Jones, Sun Young Moon, the founders of the Jehovah's Witnesses, 
		- The Churches were more focused on dealing with inter-church theological disputes, and thus left the Church ill-prepares and ill-protected from cultic false doctrines. 
		- [[Mark-13#v21|Mark 13:21-22]] *Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it. For there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.*
	- There arose men in Corinth who were self-proclaimed Apostles. 
	- ‚≠ê: Do not think that you and I are immune to these false teachers and doctrines. Be on guard. 
- How can we recognize these cults? 
	- Generally those with cultic tendencies do not appear any different from any other person in the pews. 
		- [[Matt-07#v15|Matthew 7:15-16]] *You will know them by their fruits* 
		- [[2 Cor-11#v14|2 Corinthians 11:14]] *Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light*
	- Traits to look out for: 
		- *authoritarian tendencies*
		- *totalitarian behavior*
		- *they bring you into bondage*: 
			- If you join a cult, you are going to end up a slave. 
			- Cults tie you down in authoritarian, arbitrary, capricious rules. 
			- But when you first meet cults, they act quite friendly. Like the friendliest people you have ever seen.
				- *If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.*
				- they flatter you, feed you, touch you, hug you. 
					- This is manipulation to draw you in, and to indebt yourself to them. 
			- Then they will cut you off from the rest of the world, anything and everything that could threaten their power over you.
				- You will be conditioned to stop thinking, and to simply accept everything they teach and command. 
				- All individuality is strongly prohibited. 
				- The leader is hailed and exalted. 
					- They demand absolute and unquestioning loyalty. 
				- Any other leader is deemed to be satanic. 
		- *The cults devour you*
			- [[Ezek-34#v1|Ezekiel 34:1-4]]: The priests and levites were compared to corrupt shepherds who neglected to feed the sheep, and in fact robbed from the sheep by eating from their food. 
			- [[Mark-12#v40|Mark 12:40]] : The Pharisees took advantage of widows: 
				- They would offer to arbitrate disputes of wills so that they could take a portion of the inheritance. 
			- They take not only your money. 
- What are some traits and behaviors of cults in our text? 
	- *The cults take people captive*
		- John 9: The Pharisees pressured the blind man and his parents. 
			- [[John-09#v34|John 9:34]] The Pharisees persecute this man for even daring to question them. 
			- They cast the man out of the synagogue. 
		- There are two disturbing tendencies in our human nature: 
			- the desire to become more powerful, to become a pope
			- the desire to have a powerful person over you
	- *the cults strike you on the face*
		- Perhaps Paul here is talking about a specific act of physical aggression that happened in Corinth. 
		- Or perhaps Paul is talking about when cultists malign and hurt your reputation 
		- [[1 Sam-01|1 Samuel 1]]: Hannah was at the temple, praying, and Eli the priest accused her of being drunk
			- Ministers can jump to wrong conclusions
			- Jesus called these false teachers **wolves** in sheep's clothing. 
				- they are vicious, injurious, savage and vindictive

## Application
- What are some important truths that keep us from these traps? 
	- 1. Jesus Christ **alone** is King over His church
		- [[1 Cor-04#v3|1 Corinthians 4:3-4]] : *God is my judge*. 
			- It is natural for us to want human approval but for us the approbation of Jesus Christ is far more important than any man's approval or praise. 
				- Wow! What a deliverance this is for us from any tyrant. 
	- 2. The priesthood of His church
		- Christ has made every Christian a prophet, a priest, and a king unto Him[^1]. 
		- God made man in His own image, and in that made man a prophet, a priest and a king. 
			- prophet: they knew the truth and spoke in the truth. 
				- after the fall man did not speak the truth. 
			- priest: they taught others who God is and provide atonement for sin
				- mediates between God and sinful man. 
			- king: *fill the earth and subdue it*
				- man's task is to **rule** over all creation 
				- man is still ruling to this day, but after the fall man is ruling improperly and sinfully
		- After the fall man still had these offices but now failed at fulfilling them.  
		- Christ is the new Adam and fulfills what sinful man could not
			- [[1 Pet-02#v5|1 Peter 2:5, 9]] *you are a royal priesthood*
			- [[Heb-13#v10|Hebrews 13:10]]: We have and altar
				- if we have an altar then that means we are priests
					- objection: Well Jesus is the priest of the altar
					- rebuttal see v15: it is us who offer the sacrifice. That's what a priest does. 
			- [[Rev-01#v6|Revelation 1:6]]: *He has made us kings and priests* 
	- 3. The blessedness of adoption: 
		- Our Father loves us more deeply than any other human ever could. 
		- Let us not put a yoke of bondage around Christ's children
	- 4. the example of the good shepherd: 
		- See how wonderfully patient the LORD is with His disciples. 
		- He is tender, courteous, approachable and forgiving. 
		- He came to seek and save the lost
		- [[John-09#v39|John 9:35-39]]: *Jesus came to bring sight to the blind* 
- Come to Jesus today.
