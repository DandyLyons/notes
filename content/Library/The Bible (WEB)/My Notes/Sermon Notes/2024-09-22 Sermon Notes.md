## üìñBible Passage
>[!NOTE]+ 2 Corinthians 12:10
>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, **for Christ's sake**. ==For when I am weak, then am I strong.==

## Points

- Paul says two things about infirmities: 
	- He takes pleasure in his infirmities
	- It is when he is weak that he is strong
- Infirmities are any of those things that display and manifest our weaknesses: 
	- Including ridicule and persecution, and our deficiencies. 
- **When I am weak then I am streak**
	- Consider the converse: "when I am strong, then I am weak"
		- Some people think that they are very strong, but they are not. 
			- They have false hope in their competencies. But they are lacking. 
			- They may admit that they have faults, but falsely believe that their faults are so small as to be negligible. 
			- They believe that they are justified by their merit. 
			- **But this belief in our legal merit is false and mistaken**
			- Case study: [[Luke-18#The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector|The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector]] 
				- The pharisee thought he was strong in his own merit. 
				- He exalted himself and he was not humble. 
		- ‚≠ê You cannot keep the law of God, for you have already broken it. 
		- Your imaginary strength is really making you weak. 
	- You might object thinking, "I already know that I need to be humble, and to believe in my need for Jesus." But **you falsely believe that you can believe when you want, in your own power.**
		- Case Study: The humble tax collector: [[Luke-18#v13: Luke 18:13]]. 
			- Unlike the prideful Pharisee, the tax collector dared not even to look to Heaven (for he knew that he was unworthy), nevertheless he desperately pleaded for mercy (for he knew that God is merciful). 
	- There are even Christians who think themselves to be strong:
		- Many are strong in knowledge of the word: 
			- and yet many of these knowledgeable Christians are the same who deny faith, and accept heresy. 
			- They were so strong that they became weaker than others. 
			- When we are wise in our own eyes, it is then that we become fools. 
			- **Do not be head strong, or strong in the head (which is much the same thing).** 
		- **We cannot perform even the smallest righteous act without God's help.**
		- Case study: Solomon was the wisest man, and yet he committed such great folly. 
		- Case study: the Israelites trusted in their own wisdom, and therefore decided to trust the Gibeonites who deceived them. 
			- Clearly they should have prayed and sought God on this decision, 
			- But instead they thought this matter was so clear that that would be unnecessary. 
			- Being wise, they were fools. 
		- [[Prov-03#v5|Proverbs 3:5-6]] : *Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don't lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.*
		- [[Isa-40#v29|Isaiah 40:29]]: God gives power to the weak. 
- **For when I am weak then I am strong**
	- What does *when* mean here?: 
		- When we are increasingly aware of our weaknesses. 
		- Paradox: As we grow in our knowledge of God and scripture, we are broken for we see our weaknesses more and more. We respond in a few ways:
			- We run from our weaknesses because they are offensive and scary. This is a poor choice. 
			- We are dejected and lamenting. 
			- Paul, shows us another and better way: **Embrace** your weakness. Don't run from it. Rejoice in it for you know that it is only when you are humbled that you are able to trust in God. 
	- What does *then* mean here? 
		- **then I am strong**: when will I be strong? How? 
		- When you are **consciously** weak. 
			- When you explicitly acknowledge your weakness. 
			- When you explicitly place your trust in God. 
		- Prayer: the one who is weak turns to the LORD for strength. 
		- ‚≠ê **There is no power or strength apart from God.** 
		- **A sense of weakness focuses us**
			- It creates in us a sense of urgency: *I must do my utmost to serve God*
