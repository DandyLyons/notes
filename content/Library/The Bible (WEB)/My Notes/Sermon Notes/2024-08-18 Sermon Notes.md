## Points

- God gives us abundantly, far more than we deserve. 
	- Perhaps you think that you do not have enough. Do you not realize that we have so much in this country. We have full pantries. 
	- This verse is not just to encourage poor people, but for all people to realize that our God meets all our daily needs. 
- The more God gives us, the more we should take care not to squander God's rich blessings. 
	- Abortion is a sin because it deprives these children from receiving God's rich blessings. 
		- We must not be apathetic, nor think that the problems and atrocities have been solved. 
		- God has created us in His own image. We are not animals. We must not get used to this crime. 
		- Psalm 104:15 applies even to the unborn. 
- We need to remind others that Jesus Christ is the bread of life which we all need. 
- God provides for all of the needs of our physical body.
	- Food, clothing, water, air and so much more. 
- **Everything comes to us from the good hand of God to meet our daily needs.** 
	- We ought to have humility. It is not us who provide for our needs, but God. 
	- Pay attention to how little we deserve, and yet how much we receive from God. 
		- We deserve death and hell for the sinners we are, and yet God gives us such grace. 
		- We ought to praise and thank the LORD for each and every blessing. 
		- Every breath you take is a gift from God. Every heart pump. 
			- If you live 70 years, your heart pumps about 2.5 billion times. 
		- [[1 Cor-10#v31|1 Corinthians 10:31]] : Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
	- The world tells us to fight for what we deserve, 
		- But the truth is we do not deserve more. 
		- This path does not lead to happiness, for you will always want more, feel entitled to more, and feel disappointed with what you have. 
- This text is not a list of demands for us to place upon God. It is all for the glory and praise of God. 
	- These blessings are not for just our benefit, but for His glory and praise. 
	- We should bow before God's providence, in humility. 
	- Riches tempt us to become proud like Pharaoh, who denied God. 
		- It is so easy for us to covet what others have. 
		- Riches cause us to desire materials and luxury, but these things do not satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts. 
	- We should trust in Him to provide. 
- This text shows that God not only provides for us, but he knows precisely how much we need, how and when we need it. 
	- When God asks us "Have you lacked anything?" we can answer only "Nothing LORD. You have given me everything I need and more."
- We should acknowledge God and thank Him for all the gifts that He gives. 
	- The ability to walk and talk and think, these all come from the LORD. 
	- God does not owe you any of these things. 
	- ‚≠ê Thank the LORD, every meal, every day and every moment. 
- It is one thing to receive things from God, it is another thing to receive God's blessings. 
	- God's blessing is not with the gifts that He gives. 
	- We want God's blessings with all that He gives.
		- We don't just need God to give us good things, we need His blessings upon what He gives us. 
	- Sometimes God gives curses: 
		- [[Prov-03#v33|Proverbs 3:33]]: God's curse is in the house of the wicked. 
		- [[Ps-127#v1|Psalm 127:1]] *unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain*
		- [[Luke-16#v25|Luke 16:25]] : The rich man received his good things in his life time, and received his just punishment after his death. 
- We must withdraw our trust in all creatures, and trust in God alone: 
	- by our own nature we trust ourselves and we trust others. 
		- But we are weak and cannot provide for all our needs. 
		- It is God who provides, not us. 
	- transfer your trust from man to God. 
		- that is when we really honor God. 

## Application
- 1. Our text is a powerful cure for [[anxiety]]. 
	- Most of the time **anxiety** is inseparable from unbelief. 
		- We become anxious because we do not feel in control, and we have forgotten that God is always in control. 
		- We should find comfort in our text and reduces and eliminates our anxieties. 
- 2. This text is a good cure for our [[complaining]]. 
	- Complaining is another sign of unbelief, because it is an expression that we are dissatisfied for what God has given us. 
	- [[Phil-02#v14|Philippians 2:14-16]] *do all things without complaining*
	- No believer has any reason to complain
- 3. this text is a cure for [[envy]]
	- <u>Envy is thinking that someone has what you should have</u>
	- You are not entitled to anything you have. 
	- It is God's right to do whatever He wants with all that He has made. 
		- [[Matt-20#v13|Matthew 20:13-16]] 
	- Be satisfied with what the LORD has given you. 
- 4. this text teaches us to transfer all our trust to God
	- Pray "*LORD help me to day to rest in your provision for all my needs.*"
	- the very bread on my table, even if it is just a crumb reminds me that Jesus is the bread of life. 
	- He will not leave us nor forsake us. 
	- God is not a state welfare office, He is our Heavenly Father who hears us and provides for us. 
	- [[Ps-34#v8|Psalm 34:8-10]]: *taste and see that the LORD is God. Blessed is the man who trusts in HIm.*
