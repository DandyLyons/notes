>[!NOTE]+ Psalm 104:14
>He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may produce food out of the earth: 

## Points

- God produces all the Earth's food. Man does not and cannot create food. 
	- We rely on God to grow food. 
	- This should humble us. 
	- This should cause us to thank God. 
	- [[Gen-01#v29|Genesis 1:29]] God gave every green plant to us for food
	- God also provides the grass for the cattle and the cattle for man. 
- On the other hand, this world is blind to the works of God. 
	- This world speaks of *natural laws* but laws themselves cannot act upon themselves. Something must act, something must create  and enact the laws and govern the world and conform the world to those laws. 
	- Today we say *It rained*, whereas the ancients would say *God rained on the Earth*. 
		- This kind of language is our meager attempt to forget that it is God who is in command of the weather and the universe. 
	- [[Ps-104#v3|Psalm 104:3]]: *God makes the clouds His chariot*. We should see God in the clouds and throughout the universe. 
- Nothing works by itself, apart from God. 
	- The trees don't grow by themselves, the sun doesn't shine by itself, the jet engine doesn't spin by itself. 
	- God's power, and wisdom sustains and propels all things. 
- 1. Our God is an untiring worker. 
	- We ought to see God even in common things. 
		- God makes grass to grow. Yes God is even in the grass. 
		- He's in your every day life. 
		- Do not say *I must see a miracle, in order to see God.* 
			- Really, every single part of creation is a manifestation of God. God is at work in it all. 
	- The little things in life are often the greatest troubles. Yet God is present in it all. 
	- God makes every single part of the universe live and grow and move. 
		- Even the grass growing, high in the mountains, far off the trail, where no traveler has ever seen. 
		- Are you oppressed, beaten or forgotten? Do not fret. God has not even forgotten you. 
- 2. God is also a great caretaker: 
	- The works of God care for His creation, providing for our needs. 
	- [[1 Cor-09#v9|1 Corinthians 9:9-18]] 
		- God's command that *you shall not muzzle the ox* shows that God cares for all the animals of the field
		- It also shows that God wants His servants to be provided for by their labor.
	- [[Ps-147#v9|Psalm 147:9]]: God even provides for the defiled ravens. 
	- God cares for the beasts of the field even when they are too dumb to speak. Even though they shed no tears for repentance. 
		- ‚≠ê How much more does God care for us, whom He died for and made in His own image? 
	- God cares for us, even when no one else does. 
	- God even cares for us by providing suitable food to us. 
		- God provides grass for the cattle, just the sort of food that the cattle need to grow and thrive. 
		- God is not merely *trying to help*. He is actually helpful. Actually meeting our needs. 
		- He cares enough to want to help, cares enough to know precisely how to help, cares enough to do the work necessary to actually help. 
- So let us see God's hand of [[providence]]. 
	- Let us see his providence, not only in times of plenty, but even in times of lack. 
	- Trust in the LORD's gracious and bountiful provision for you and all creatures. 
	- God provides
		- [[2 Sam-09#v7|2 Samuel 9:7, 23]] 
		- [[Ps-23#v2|Psalm 23:2]] 
		- In [[The Lord‚Äôs Supper]], God feeds us, not only with physical food, but the spiritual food that we desperately need. 
	- God feeds you and cares for you. He has not forgotten any of your needs. 
- You can trust God's good and perfect plan
	- Every winter precedes a time of growth and abundance. 
	- God is providing for us even when we don't see it. Even when we don't understand. Even when we experience lack, pain, or adversity. 
		- [[Isa-55#v9|Isaiah 55:9]]: *His ways are higher than our ways*
		- [[Rom-08#v32|Romans 8:32]]: *God who gave us His own Son, How would He not also freely give us all things?*
		- God is not against us. He is for us, and if He is for us, who could be against us.
			- Therefore, we ought to thank God not only for the blessings but even for the adversity He sends. 
			- Sooner or later we all experience such great pain that we feel that no one else could understand. Take it to Jesus. He understands, and He cares.
