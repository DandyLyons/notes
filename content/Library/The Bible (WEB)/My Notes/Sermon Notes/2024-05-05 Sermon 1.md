## Points

- The soldiers mocked and tortured Jesus before His crucifixion. 
- As part of their mocking they placed a crown of thorns on Him: 
	- This was a mockery of Jesus' Kingly identity: 
		- They gave Him a scarlet robe
		- They gave Him a crown of thorns
		- They gave Him a reed (presumably to be used as a sort of sceptre)
		- They taunted Him, sarcastically: *Hail, King of the Jews!*
	- If Jesus is King why did He not stop this abuse?
		- The answer is because it was necessary that these things should be fulfilled. 
			- These things were prophesied
				- e.g. *Psalm 22*. Isaiah 53
				- Yet these men were still responsible for their own wickedness. 
					- God is never the author of sin. 
				- The sinfulness of these mocking soldiers is a reflection of our own sinfulness. 
					- Every one of our sins is another thorn in Christ's crown
					- We mock Him when we make hypocritical professions of allegiance to Him.
					- Every time we mock someone else, or treat them as anything less than the image of God, we are mocking God. 
					- If you are not saved today, then you are no better than these soldiers. 
- The crown shows us that Jesus is the great high priest
	- Historically, the great high priest in the temple has always worn a crown, a magnificent headpiece. But Jesus's crown is quite unique, made of thorns. 
	- The thorn is the symbol of God's curse against us sinners.
		- [[Gen-03#v17|Genesis 3:17-18]] : *the land will yield thorns*. This was God's curse against sinful man. 
		- [[Heb-06#v7|Hebrews 6:7-8]]: *but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.*
	- These soldiers are taking the symbol of sin and crowning God with it. 
		- ‚ùì How could God who cannot overlook sin, allow His Son to be crowned with the very symbol of sin? 
	- Christ the great high priest comes to represent man, with a crown of thorns upon His head. 
		- This is the crown that we deserved, the crown of substitution. 
	- Thank God! That we as sinners never need to know the pain of wearing the crown of thorns, because Jesus has worn it for us in our place. 
	- Though it was the soldiers who placed this crown, it was God who was working behind them and through them to make this happen. 
		- Yet Jesus did not, could not, and would not respond to this abuse. 
			- Though He could have called down fire from Heaven, obliterating God's enemies with just a word, yet He did not. Why? 
				- so that He would be a suitable substitute for us sinners. 
				- Jesus was the second Adam. 
					- Through the first Adam we receive the curse of thorns. 
					- But through Jesus, the second Adam, we receive blessing through the crown of thorns. 
- What should our response to this be? 
	- First we should consider what we actually deserved.
	- Second, we should consider what grace we received and how greatly is cost Christ. 
- Is Christ **your** substitute? 
	- Perhaps you think *I have met many difficulties, and I have endured through them all without Jesus.*
		- Can you endure the wrath of punishment for your sins without Jesus? 
			- Surely you have earned your crown of thorns. 
	- No, do not go on as you are. **You need this crowned Savior**
		- You will either live by the cross or perish by the cross. 
- The crown shows us that Jesus is the King
	- Jesus was hailed as King: [[Matt-27#v29|Matthew 27:29, 37]] 
	- We need not only a priest and a prophet to intercede for us. 
	- We also need a **King** to rule over us and guide us and love us. 
		- If Jesus is willing to give this much for you, then you can be certain that He will do all that is necessary, until He accomplishes your finished salvation. 
			- Hebrews calls this *so great a salvation*
- The crown shows Jesus' incomprehensible love for us.

## Application
- use this crown as medicine for
	- all your spiritual ailments
		- When you are afflicted remember, *none of my afflictions even begin to compare to the affliction on Christ*
	- all your temptations
		- *Will I flirt with sin after He gave me so great a love and salvation*
	- remember that Christ is also an example: 
		- If Christ was silent while reviled, then so should I be. 
		- [[1 Pet-02#v21|1 Peter 2:21-23]] : *When he was cursed, he didn't curse back. When he suffered, he didn't threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously.*
	- use this crown of thorns as a call to justice
		- crown Him with many crowns
		- profess Jesus Christ as our only King
		- Give Christ the crown He deserves, not this mocking crown. 
	- rest in the safety of this crown of thorns. 
		- There is no safer place. 
			- [[Rev-22#v3|Revelation 22:3-5]] : *There will be no curse any more.*
