## Points

- How does God relate to us? 
	- Like a father toward his children. 
	- He has compassion (pity) on us. 
		- Why? Because He remembers how we are made (fragile), remembering that we are dust. 
		- See [[Matt-07#God is our Loving Father|Matthew 7]] 
- Who does God have pity toward? 
	- Toward *those who fear Him*. [[Ps-103#v11|Psalm 103:11]] 
- Yet, we need to be careful not to say *God looks down on those who are terrified of Him*
	- There is no disdain, or oppression in the pity of God toward His children. 
	- God does not pity in the same way that the rich pity the poor man. 
		- There are some that have a way of giving a gift that is so condescending. It is not out of love, but instead a way to display power. 
		- He has paternal, patience, tenderness, and generosity toward us. 
- Our Father in Heaven is not the same as our father on earth. 
	- See: [[Matt-07#v11]], [[Luke-11#v11|Luke 11:11-13]] 
		- We should not look at our flawed father on earth and think *I don't want a god who is like my father*. 
		- Instead we should look at our perfect, loving, patient, gentle, caring Father in Heaven, and think to ourselves *This is what a father should be like*!
	- Matthew Henry: The father pitieth his children that are weak in knowledge and instructs them. When they are fallen, he helps them up again. When they are wronged, he rights them. 
- *God knows our frame*
	- This means, God knows how we are put together, what we are made of. 
	- We might be thinking, *surely God knows how I deserve His favor. Can't God see how good I am?*
		- Banish this thought! We are not strong, nor worthy, nor deserving, nor self-sufficient. 
		- What are we? *"We are dust"*. 
			- [[Gen-02#v7|Genesis 2:7]]
			- [[Gen-03#v19|Genesis 3:19]]
				- *Dust you are, and to dust you shall return.* 
			- Here today, and gone tomorrow. 
			- We are mortal. 
			- I am dust, and the LORD knows. 
				- He pities us and has patience for us, remembering how feeble and flawed we are. Accounting for every burden, sorrow, and challenge we face. 
	- God knows our human nature
		- Who knows humans better than the One who designed us and made us. 
	- God knows us individually and personally. 
		- He know *you*, yes *you*. Not just anyone, but each and every one of us. 
- Your Father forgives you simply because He loves you.
