## ðŸ“–Bible Passage
>[!NOTE]+ 2 Corinthians 11:26-29
>I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers; 
in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness. 
Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily: anxiety for all the assemblies. 
Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I don't burn with indignation? 

See also: [[Acts-27]] where Paul, a prisoner being transported to Rome for trial, prophesied that a great storm would capsize their ship. 
## Points

- 1. What is remarkable about Paul's list of credentials? 
	- In [[2 Cor-11#v22|2 Corinthians 11:22]], Paul starts listing his credentials, but notice his *credentials* are quite different from what you might expect. 
		- You would think that Paul would list his heritage, his background, success, achievements, bona fides, or even his well-respected teachers. 
		- Paul instead lists his [[suffering]]. 
			
	- **Clearly Paul believes that it is <u>suffering</u>[^1] that is the best evidence of a Christian.**
- 2. Why is suffering the truest and purest evidence of a servant of Christ? 
	- Scripture tells us that servants of Christ should expect to suffer and be persecuted. 
		- [[Matt-22#v6|Matthew 22:6]] 
	- Suffering marks the life of a Christian. 
		- Not every Christian will suffer to the same degree that Paul did. 
			- In fact, few Christians have ever suffered as much as Paul did. 
		- But all believer in Jesus, Christ will receive persecution. 
		- [[Matt-05#v10|Matthew 5:10]]
- 3. What perils does Paul list in verse 26 and 27? 
	- *In journeys often*
		- Paul did 3 missionary journeys, across the world. 
	- *perils of rivers*: 
		- there were few bridges at this time. Many river crossings were a life threatening event. 
	- *perils of my own countrymen*:
		- Other fellow Jews sought to kill Paul. 
		- Some Jews did believe Jesus was Christ, and were converted. But not all. 
		- His own countrymen were enraged by Paul, and sought to kill him because Paul preached that Jesus was God and Savior. 
	- *perils in the city*
		- They sought to kill him in Damascus, Syria, Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Thessalonica, Berea, Corinth, Ephesus
	- *perils from the Gentiles*

	- *perils in the wilderness*
		- in danger from wild animal attacks
		- dangers on the sea. [[Acts-27|Acts 27]]
	- *perils among false brothers*: 
		- Is there anything worse than a traitor like Judas Iscariot? Someone who comes alongside you like a brother or friend, and yet betrays you when you are most vulnerable. 
		- [[Gal-02#v4|Galatians 2:4-5]] False brethren infiltrated secretly, seeking to undermine the Gospel. 
			- False apostles at Corinth. 
			- The Judaisers. 
			- [[Acts-20#v29|Acts 20 29-30]] 
		- TAKEAWAY: Paul was so devoted Christ, that he endured all these things 
	- *in weariness and toil* (in labor and travail):
		- Paul worked even to the point of exhaustion. 
		- He not only ministered for Christ ,but provided for himself, financially so that he would not be a burden.

	- *in hunger and thirst*: 
		- [[2 Tim-04#v13|2 Timothy 4:13]]   
		- Paul did not live in luxury, and comfort
		- [[Rom-08#v18|Romans 8:18]]  Paul considered his suffering to be nothing in comparison to the riches found in Christ. 
		- [[Rom-08#v35|Romans 8:35]] Paul believed that no amount of suffering will separate us from the love of Christ. 
	- He was imprisoned many times
	- lashed even to the point of near-death
	- beatings and stonings
	- Shipwrecked at sea
	- robbed

	- Paul felt for the Churches deeply.
