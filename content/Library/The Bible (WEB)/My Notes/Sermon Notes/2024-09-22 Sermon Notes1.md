## Points

- What does Paul say about the love of God in Romans 8? 
	- [[Rom-08#v38|Romans 8:38]]
- God is love
	- We see this statement also in [[1 John-04#v8|1 John 4:8]]
- We will look at: 
	- 3 things this does not mean
	- 3 things that this does mean
	- 3 things that this should teach us
- 3 things this does NOT mean: 
	- It does not mean that love is God
		- Many people will say that God is love and therefore that God does not condemn. This is not taught in the Bible. 
		- Or people will say that God is *primarily* love. As if there were gradations
			- Yet God is one in Himself, and all of God's attributes are one. 
			- If we say God is primarily love than we end up with selfishness and hedonism, and being a god unto one's self. 
			- If we say that God is primarily justice, then we end up with legalism 
			- God is infinite in love and holiness and justice and goodness and all the other attributes of God
		- God is not a hateful, spiteful and capricious God. 
	- It does not mean that anything that **we** deem is loving is God
- 3 things that this DOES mean: 
	- God is love in His very essence. 
		- God IS love. It is part of God's own essence. 
		- The Bible also says 
			- God IS spirit. It does not say God *has* a spirit. 
			-  God IS light. It does not say God *has* light. 
		- God is love in Himself. He's not just loving to others. He is love. 
			- God is even loving amongst the three Persons of the Trinity, even in eternity past. 
		- God cannot NOT be love. He must be love. It is core to who He is. 
		- Love is not merely **part** of God. God does not have parts. 
		- God is not merely at a higher level of love than we are. 
			- It is not as if there is some standard of love that is higher than Him, that He corresponds to. No God IS love. 
		- God does not **derive** love from some other source. 
			- His love is self-generating. 
				- The moon simply reflects the light of the sun. But the sun is the source of light itself. Such is God. 
		- We couldn't possibly exhaust all of God's love. There is no limit to His love. 
			- Spurgeon: *We can no more exhaust the love of God, than a little fish could drink up all the oceans of the world. So drink up little fish.*
			- Martin Luther: *If there were a thousand worlds, one drop of Christ's blood as all the infinity in it necessary to save a thousand worlds.* 
			- Jonathan Edwards has a sermon named <u>Heaven is a world of love.</u>
	- God is love means that this is essential to God's very identity. 
		- What was in eternity past. Nothing, except for God. 
			- So how could God be love, if there is nothing to love. 
				- Love requires an object, something that is loved. 
					- God is both the subject and the object. 
					- God is both the lover and the beloved. 
					- This is why John 1 says both that the Word was **with** God and the Word **was** God. 
				- The answer is that God loves Himself. 
					- There's nothing wrong with God loving Himself, because God is good, pure and holy and worthy of love. 
					- The Bible numerously repeats that the Father loves the Son. 
					- In fact, the Father, Spirit and Son  love each other and have always loved each other. 
	- God is love and therefore God **displays** His love: 
		- God chose to allow creation to see and experience His love
			- He especially loves His elect. His people. 
			- God loves all His creation, but He does not love all His creation equally. 
				- [[John-17#v26|John 17:26]]: God's elect are the love gift of God. 
- How should we then live
	- We should treasure the love of God in our hearts. 
		- [[Rom-05#v5|Romans 5:5]]: this is what we should treasure more and more and more. 
			- Ask for God to pour His love into your heart through the Holy Spirit. 
	- This love should cause us to **worship the triune God**: 
		- Jesus loves you with the same eternal, unchangeable and infinite love that the Father loves His Son. [[John-17#v26|John 17:26]]
			- This should compel you to worship Him. We should want to bring Him all the honor and glory and honor that belongs to Him (and to Him alone). 
	- We should love one another **sacrificially** out of the love of Christ: 
		- John is saying that a believer ought to be willing to die for another believer, because it is what Christ did for us. 
		- Sin naturally turns us inward into selfishness.
