## Points

- God made everything in the world, despite what everyone else may say. 
	- There are only about a dozen homes in history that have sold for over $100 million. Yet all of those homes combined, do not compare to the size, majesty, grandeur, and beauty of the home of all creation which God made. 
	- *The Earth is the LORD's footstool.*
	- Jesus is the one who created all things:
		- [[Col-01#v15|Colossians 1:15-17]] 
		- [[Rev-04#v11|Revelation 4:11]] 
	- [[Gen-01#v1|Genesis 1:1]] : God is the creator of all things that exist. 
		- Before creation, nothing existed except for God. 
		- God created all things *out of nothing*, *ex nihilo*. 
		- He created all things simply by speaking. He used no thing except His own power. 
- God made all things. How did He do it? By His Word. 
	- [[Ps-104#v7|Psalm 104:7]]: The waters fled at God's rebuke, at His voice, thus creating dry land. 
		- God did not speak as humans speak, with a human voice. 
- Psalm 104 teaches us to fix our gaze on God, who created the universe. 
	- All of God. God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 
- The Bible never says that there was any element of chance, randomness or evolution in creation. 
	- God was and is the only cause of creation. 
	- There are no evolutionary processes described in the scriptures. 
	- Moses taught that the world was literally created by God in 6 days. 
		- Moses was no fool, but was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. [[Acts-07#v22|Acts 7:22]] 
	- Jesus also taught and believed the creation story. 
		- There is no evidence that Jesus disagreed with any part of the Bible. 
		- [[Matt-19#v4|Matthew 19:4-6]]: Jesus quoted from Genesis 1 and 2. 
			- If you get Genesis wrong, then you get the Bible wrong. It will be the beginning of the unravelling of sound doctrine. 
		- [[Exod-31#v15|Exodus 31:15]] shows that the creation story does in fact affect our theology. 
	- [[Rom-01#v20|Romans 1:19-20]] God reveals Himself in creation, and therefore we are without excuse. 
- Psalm 104 affirms Genesis 1 and teaches it as true and accurate. 
- Where does Paul go to establish the status and identity of man and God? Paul uses the creation story as evidence. 
	- [[Rom-09#v20|Romans 9:20-21]]: 
- We also learn that **all that God has made is good**. 
	- [[Gen-01#v31|Genesis 1:31]]
	- [[Ps-104#v24|Psalm 104:24, 31]] : *Yahweh, how many are your works! In wisdom, you have made them all. The earth is full of your riches.*
	- Goodness is all over Psalm 104. 
	- This is so unlike the world, because the world hates the works of God. 
		- The trans movement hates the works of God. It teaches *no, God did not make me, and does not get to tell me what to do. Only I get to decide what I do.*
			- The doctrine of creation teaches that God *made us man and woman*, and he made us *very good*. He made you to reflect His own glory. He made you with wisdom and with power. 
- Does creation cause you to worship God? 
	- Do you live every day to serve your Creator? You should. This is your purpose: to glorify and enjoy God, forever. 
		- If you don't know Him, nor want to know Him, then you are living in Jesus. 
		- Come to Jesus. He is the **only one** who can save you, deliver you from the misery of your sin. Only He can soften your hard heart and stubborn will. 
		- Only He can make you a new creation. [[2 Cor-05#v17|2 Corinthians 5:17-21]]
