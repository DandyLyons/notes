## Points

- Jesus came with power and demonstrated it with miraculous works. 
	- Jesus preached the Word with power. 
- Here in our text: 
	- Jesus and His disciples had just crossed the Sea of Galilee
	- There was a great and terrible storm 
	- Jesus rebuked the storm with His voice and the storm became still
- About the Gadarenes: 
	- This is Gentile non-Jewish land
	- This is the first time in Jesus' ministry that He left Jewish land and entered Gentile territory. 
	- These were pig herders. Pig was explicitly declared to be unclean by the Levitical law. 
- As soon as they land in the Gadarenes they immediately encounter a man possessed by demons: 
	- We learn from this, that demons are indeed real and active in their opposition to God. 
	- This demon possessed man would constantly cry out loudly and **cut himself with stones**[^1]
		- We should learn and understand that **demons and Satan seek only to destroy and harm us**. They bring nothing good to us. They desire blood, death and destruction. 
	- Notice that the demons had no power over Christ. 
		- They could not for Christ to do anything against His will. 
		- They were subject to Christ's power and dominion. They could not do anything against Christ's will. 
			- If Christ could conquer the demons in this man, surely He can do this in us and our communities. 
		- They had to ask Christ for permission to be sent into the pigs. 
- Jesus came not only to free us but also to destroy Satan and the realm of darkness. 
	- [[Rev-12#9|Revelation 12:9]]
	- Jesus lived to destroy the powers of darkness.
	- Jesus also **died** to destroy the devil
		- [[Heb-02#v14|Hebrews 2:14]] : *Jesus also himself in the same way died, so that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,* 
	- Jesus also destroyed Satan's sway (influence): 
		- At this time, Satan had power over almost all the world. 
		- After, Christ's ministry, the Gospel spread throughout the world. 
	- Jesus destroyed the realm of Satan. 
- ðŸ’¡ Unbelief destroys souls: 
	- Everything influenced by demons leads to destruction. 
		- Even the pigs died. Not even the animals are spared from the destruction of demons. 
	- Yet Christ completely changed the life of the demon-possessed man. 
		- Now he was freed from the demons. 
		- He was sane, sober, calm, and loving. 
	- Yet seeing this man who was saved, what was the response of the people in the community? 
		- Did they thank Jesus for solving a problem, for saving a broken man?
		- Did they ask to also be saved by Jesus, this man of great power? 
		- No, they asked Him to leave, because their pigs (their livelihood) had died. 
			- They valued their financial stability even over their own salvation and eternity. 
		- Do not make the same mistake as these people. 
- Then Jesus left the Gadarenes. 
- And the man begged Jesus to let him follow Jesus. 
- Yet curiously, Jesus **did not** allow him. Instead, He commanded the man to proclaim the good news to the Gentiles in the Gadarenes. 
	- [[Mark-05#v19|Mark 5:19]] 
## Application
- Do not be afraid of the terrifying power of Satan and his demons. 
- Hold faith to God and Christ who has overcome Satan. 
- Be like the Gadarenes man: 
	- who begged Jesus to let Him follow
- Will you and I tell the people in our community *what great things God has done for you?*
	- How will they hear unless the Word of God is preached to them?
