## Points

- The saint and martyr is bold in war and conflict, knowing that they serve god and he will not fail them. 
- Here in Proverbs 21:30-31, we are taught that the LORD alone gives us the victory. 
	- Today, as in all days we need men with courage. 
		- Those who know what they fight to protect and who love it dearly. 
	- God's people have always had to face a day of battle. Every generation faces this. 
		- But we must always remember that the outcome of the battle depends on the LORD and His intervention into the situation. 
		- The Christian church first had to face persecution from the Jews, then the Romans, then false teachers within the Church, then the Pagans. And on and on. 
- ‚ùì: What is the battle in our day? 
	- We must remember, that in our day, and in every generation of the Christian church, our battle is not a battle of flesh and blood. We fight against the spiritual dark forces of Satan. 
	- This battle continues even in our day. Though it may not be physical harm for most Christians in America today, this battle still continues today. 
		- Ecumenical apostasy
			- Those who seek to remove every truth of the Gospel and replace it with every false teaching imaginable. 
		- Liberalism: though it comes in many forms and labels, what they have in common is the denial of the word of God. 
		- Syncretism: the teaching that Christianity should be mixed with other religions. 
		- Secularism: the aim to drive God and Christianity out of all public life. 
		- Relativism: 
		- Pragmatism: 
- ‚ùì: Who are the warriors in the battle? 
	- God provided the Apostles as His warriors. He prepared the Reformers, the Protestants and so many other devoted men and women of God throughout the generations.
	- We are in a war. 
	- We need warriors in the Church. 
		- Wherever and whoever you are, there is a place for you in the battle. 
		- [[2 Cor-10#v4|2 Corinthians 10:4-5]] : 
			- *for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds, throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,* 
- ‚ùì: What are the  weapons in the battle? 
	- Primarily the Bible: 
		- This more than anything else has the power to change hearts and minds, and defeat strongholds. 
		- Luther's greatest work was not the 95 theses, but it was his translation of the Bible, into German, which, for the first time, placed the Word of God into the hands of common people. 
		- Ingest the Bible. Read it and be steeped in it. Learn and think in the terms of the Bible. Let it change the way that you think and act. 
		- How will we change our nation? We must use the Sword of the Holy Spirit, which is the Bible. Learn it and teach it to others. 
	- The dissemination of Christian thinking and culture.
		- We are living in a time and place, when people want to make it against the law to share the Gospel. 
	- Another weapon was and is to train up the next generation of preachers. 
		- Luther, Calvin and so many others started Seminaries, to train the next warriors in this battle. Men who know what they believe it, why they believe it and love what they know. 
	- Where are the warriors today? 
		- So many Christians are so backslidden that they are not in the fight, ill-prepared, or even leaving the cause altogether. 
			- The Prophet Jeremiah wrote of this in Jeremiah 2: 
				- The people of Israel could not find the LORD because they weren't even looking for Him: [[Jer-02#v6|Jeremiah 2:6-8]]. 
## Application
- ‚ùì: What is the only way we can win the war? 
	- If you are not saved, then plead to God to save you. 
	- If you are saved, ask the LORD how He may use you.
