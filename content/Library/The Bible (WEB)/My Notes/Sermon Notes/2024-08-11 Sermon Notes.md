## ðŸ“–Bible Passage
>[!NOTE]+ Hebrews 11:23-28
>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the kingâ€™s command.
> By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâ€™s daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward.
> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible. By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

## Points

- What did Robert Lewis Dabney say about parents and education? 
	- Dabney stressed the importance of education for training up children to be educated adults. 
	- He argued that **the education of children unto God is THE most important task on earth** 
- Our passage ([[Heb-11#Moses|Moses in Hebrews 11]]) today, is a very brief summary of Moses' life: 
	- During this time Pharaoh ordered that all male Hebrew babies were to be aborted. 
	- But **by faith**, Moses' parents chose to disobey Pharaoh, not to kill Moses. [[Heb-11#v23]]
		- Why did they do this? 
			- Because *they saw that the child was beautiful*
				- Isn't this a strange thing to highlight? Who wouldn't think a new baby is beautiful. Who would say to a mother, "wow, isn't that an ugly baby". 
					- The point of this is to show that they could see that Moses was made in the image of God, just as we all are, and therefore worthy of protection and care. 
			- and *they were not afraid of the Pharaoh's commandment* 
				- His parents disobeyed their ruler, without fear, knowing that God would protect them. 
				- Likewise we should not fear to train up our children in righteousness, fearing God, even if the authorities forbid it. 
		- It's important to note that when the author of Hebrews lists the faith of Moses, he does not start with something that **Moses** said or did, but something that was done to him. 
			- In other words, God enacted faith in Moses, starting this work even before Moses was born and could choose. 
- Moses made the monumental decision to choose Christ and His people, rather than Pharaoh and His people. 
	- At 40 years old, Moses left Egypt for Midian
	- For 40 long years, from 40 to 80 years old, Moses tended sheep in the desert. [[Heb-11#v27]] 
		- Why? God was preparing Moses for something much bigger. 
		- God is most at work, when He is invisible. 
			- Though God seemed to be inactive during Moses' 40 years in the desert, it was here that God was preparing Moses in character. 
- Perhaps you have been taught that *we need to have faith as Moses had faith*, but this teaching is incomplete: 
	- It's not that we ought to have faith so that we can be like Moses. 
	- Rather, it's that, if we truly had faith then this is how we would act. A faithful person would: 
		- not be afraid of wicked tyrants
		- would choose to fear God rather than man
		- would give up the riches of this world for the even greater riches in Christ. [[Heb-11#v26]]. 
		- would keep the covenants of God. [[Heb-11#v28]]. 
- True religion builds us up in character. 
	- Character causes us to be firm, solid, not wavering. 
- Believe in the LORD Jesus Christ. Trust in Him and He will sustain you to the end.
