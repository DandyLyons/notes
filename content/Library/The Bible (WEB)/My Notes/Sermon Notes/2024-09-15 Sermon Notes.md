## üìñBible Passage
>[!NOTE]+ 2 Corinthians 12:9-10
>He has said to me, "==My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.==" Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me. 
Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, **for Christ's sake**. ==For when I am weak, then am I strong.== 

## Points

- ‚ùì: How can you pray for strength when you are weak? 
- **The weaker we are, the more clearly God's strength can be displayed.**
	- When we are weak, God can respond, thus making it clear that it was Him and not us that answered our prayers. 
	- Paul: *"I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me."*
		- By glorying in Paul's weakness: 
			- Paul humbles himself
			- Paul takes credit off of himself.
			- Paul places the glory on Christ. 
			- Paradoxically, it is by becoming **weaker** that Paul receives Christ's **power** 
		- "**the power of Christ may <u>rest</u> on me**": 
			- *rest* here is the word tabernacle. Tent. Dwell. God dwells with us. 
- Christ's sake is the foundation of this: 
	- *Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, **for Christ's sake**. *
	- Christ is the source of my peace. 
- We want to be **strong** in ourselves, and yet we are weak and unworthy. 
	- [[Isa-40#v29|Isaiah 40:29]] : *He gives power to the weak. He increases the strength of him who has no might.* 
	- ‚ùì: Haven't you noticed that when you realize your sin and unworthiness, that it is then that you are strongest in the LORD? 
- Case study: Joseph
	- Joseph was "*strong*" in his own eyes. 
	- Joseph became weak: beaten, sold as a slave, thrown into prison. 
	- It was when Joseph became weak that he was humble enough to realize that he needed God. 
- Case study: two debtors: [[Luke-07#v41|Luke 7:41]]
- Humility benefits our Gospel witness. 
	- When we realize that God could save us (wretched, weak and sinful as we are), then we realize, **wow, If God can save me, God can truly save anyone!** 
- You will not find satisfaction when you come to the Lord's table, full. You must come empty, and hungry. Then you can eat and be satisfied. 
- Benefits of weakness: 
	- 1. Christ centeredness: 
		- When I am weak I realize that I need Christ and he must be the center. 
	- 2. We trust God more than ourselves: 
	- 3. We learn to pray better: 
		- We pray when things are going well. 
		- And we pray when we are too weak to go on. 
		- And through that we find strength in Christ
	- 4. We learn to walk by faith and not by sight. 
		- It is the weak man who: 
			- is able to cling to the promises of Christ
			- clings to the things of God: his Word, his Spirit
	- 5. Divine guidance in the gravest of difficulties
	- 6. Fellowship with God
		- [[Isa-57#v15|Isaiah 57:15]] : God says: "*I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a **contrite and humble spirit**, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.*"
	- 7. we learn the benefit of bearing our cross even when we are weak
		- [[Isa-40#v30|Isaiah 40:30-31]] : *those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run, and not be¬†==weary==. They will walk, and not¬†==faint==.*
	- 8. We learn to cast all our fears on Christ, and take solace in His mercy:
