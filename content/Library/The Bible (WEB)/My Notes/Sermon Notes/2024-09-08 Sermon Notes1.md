## Points

- We live in a time where paganism where is on the rise. 
	- In Tasmania on June 20, 2024, hundreds plunged into freezing water naked as a celebration of the shortest day of the year. This is a tradition that dates back centuries. 
	- There are many other examples where popularity of these pagan traditions are again increasing in popularity. 
	- We as Christians would be mistaken if we joined in on these traditions thinking that they are *just a bit of fun*. They are in fact examples of the enemy's influence upon the world. 
- It was God who created order and time. 
	- The earth was formless until God created it. 
	- God created the light. [[Gen-01#v3|Genesis 1:3]]
		- God used and needed no source to create the light. He simply spoke and it was so. The light existed even before there were stars or the Sun. 
		- God not only created light, He also created darkness. God creating light and darkness, alternating in sequence, and thus He created time. 
	- In [[Gen-01#The Fourth Day|The Fourth Day]] it was God who created the lights, the sun, the moon and the stars. 
		- The pagans teach that the sun, the moons and the stars are the source of life. 
		- This is not true. It is God who is the Creator of the sun, the moon, the stars and everything else. 
		- God also told us the purpose of the sun, moon and stars. 
			- [[Gen-01#v14|Genesis 1:14]]: *"God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years;"*
			- 1. to divide the day from night
			- 2. to be signs to mark seasons, days and years. 
				- God used a star as a sign to tell the wise men that the Messiah came. 
				- the stars are also signs for navigation. The north star stays fixed over the north pole, and the southern cross points to the south pole. 
				- [[Ps-19#v1|Psalm 19:1]] *the heavens declare the glory of God*
			- 3. to mark the seasons. 
				- [[Ps-104#v19|Psalm 104:19]]: *"God appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set.*
			- 4. to mark days and years: 
				- the moon and sun tell the animals when to rise and when to rest. 
				- [[Ps-104#v19|Psalm 104:19-22]]
			- 5. to give light: 
			- 6. to point to Jesus Christ: 
				- the sun moon and stars provide light, thus pointing us to Jesus who is the **greater light**
				- [[Isa-09#v2|Isaiah 9:2]]: *"The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. The light has shined on those who lived in the land of the shadow of death."*
				- [[Isa-49#v6|Isaiah 49:6]]
				- [[Isa-60#v3|Isaiah 60:3]] Nations will come to your light
				- [[John-01|John 1]] *...In Him was life and the life was the light of men*
				- [[John-08#v12|John 8:12]]
				- [[John-09#v5|John 9:5]] *I am the light of the world*
				- [[John-12#v35|John 12:35-36]] 
				- [[Rev-21#v22|Revelation 21:22-25]]: "*The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.*" 
				- [[Matt-05#v14|Matthew 5:14-16]]: Jesus: *"You are the light of the world... Let your light shine before men."* 
			- 7. God made the sun and moon **to rule**
				- [[Gen-01#v16|Genesis 1:16]] the sun rules the day, and the moon rules the night
				- [[Ps-104#v21|Psalm 104:21]] *The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God. The sun rises, and they steal away, and lie down in their dens.*  
					- The sun and moon tell the animals when to rise and when to rest. 
				- There are over 10^22 stars in the world and yet in [[Gen-01#v16|Genesis 1:16]] they are an afterthought. How can this be? 
					- It is because they are insignificant in terms of their rule over us. 
					- the stars **do not** govern us as the horoscopes teach. 
					- [[Isa-40#v26|Isaiah 40:26]] There are so many stars that humanity is incapable of counting them all. We are not even capable of observing them all. And yet God has counted and named every single one. 
				- God set the sun and moon precisely where it should be. 
					- If it were any closer to earth we would burn up. Any further and we would freeze. 
					- If the moon were any closer, twice a day, terrifying tides would flood the lands. 
					- All of this leads us to worship God who created the sun, moon and stars. 
- The light points to Jesus who is the true Light of the world. 
	- The bible teaches that the sun, moon and stars will be burnt up. They will exist no more. We will need them no more. Because Jesus Himself will provide the light. 
	- ‚ùì: Do you know that you need Jesus Christ?
