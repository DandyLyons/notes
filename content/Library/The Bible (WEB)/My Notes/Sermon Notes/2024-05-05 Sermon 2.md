## Points

- God has removed our sins from us. 
	- Oh how great is our sin. What a heavy burden or Him to remove, yet for Him it is nothing. 
	- What could be further than East from West? 
	- [[Isa-41#v12|Isaiah 41:12]]: *You shall seek them[^1] and not find them.*
- This evening we look at the glory of our forgiving God. 
	- Thomas Watson: *It is God's mercy that makes all His other attributes sweet to us.*
- When God forgives He forgives on a divine scale. 
	- His justice is divine. 
	- When God forgives He forgives in a divine way. 
- In verse 12 God reveals a problem, our transgressions. Our sins, which separate us from God. 
	- These sins cling to our souls like tar. 
	- [[Ps-51#v3|Psalm 51:3-4]] These sins belong to me. They are mine and really mine. 
		- Transgressions are an act of aggression and rebellion against God. 
	- What is the problem of our transgressions? 
		- they are not a theory, they are a painful and present reality. 
		- Our transgressions separate us from God. 
		- And there is nothing that we can do to remove our transgressions from us. 
			- If our transgressions remain then they will sink us to the depths of Hell. 
				- Hell is also not a theory, but a painful and present reality. 
- Second, in this text God reveals a solution, God. 
	- It is God who intervenes, separating us from our transgressions. 
	- God intervenes because no one else can accomplish what He can through Christ. 
		- Some people seek to remove their sins by visiting a human priest. 
			- But can a human priest free you of your sin? 
			- Some people want a program to save themselves. Some want an assurance of pardon spoken by a human, or find hope in philosophy, or government. 
				- But none of these face the real problem. They do not remove or even deal with sin and transgressions. 
				- Only God can forgive sins. 
- Third, there is also a wonder here. Who is this? 
	- This is the holy one, the law maker and giver, the one who is offended by sin. 
	- [[Ps-103#v6|Psalm 103:6]]: This might terrify you of His justice, but He protects and cares for the oppressed. 
	- When God comes to us, not with justice and wrath but mercy, it astounds us. 
	- [[Isa-43#v25|Isaiah 43:25]] : *I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake; and I will not remember your sins.*
		- How will we be freed from our transgressions? God steps in and says *I will do it.* 
		- Transgressions are against the LORD, but mercies flow from Him. 
	- This is not only about pardon, but **renewal**. 
		- It's not only God saying *I have removed* your sins, but *now you are **free**, liberated to live as my people.*
		- Your transgressions are real, personal and legal. 
			- But your transgressions are now really, personally, and legally separated from you, because of Christ. 
			- [[Heb-08#v8|Hebrews 8:8-12]]: *I will remember there sins no more.*
			- [[Ps-32|Psalm 32]] : *Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is covered.*
			- [[1 Pet-02#v24|1 Peter 2:24]] 
			- [[Lev-16|Leviticus 16]]: 
				- There are 2 goats: 
					- One goat is killed to pay for sins. 
					- the other goat receives all the guilt, shame and sin, and is sent away to be torn apart by the wild animals. 
						- Christ Himself, has born all our guilt and shame and He has taken them far away from us. 
- Who is it that enjoys these great mercies? 
	- It is *those who fear Him*. [[Ps-103#v11|Psalm 103:11]]
	- The fear of the LORD is a way that the bible talks about those who follow God. 
		- If you do not fear God, seeking to obey His commandments, trusting in Him alone, then **you will not enjoy His forgiveness**. 
		- **You cannot keep the practice and pleasure of your sin and yet be cleansed from the stain of your sin.** 
- This is the problem when we humans attempt to remove sin. 
	- The priest proclaims to the confessor that *your sins are absolved*. Wrongly. 
	- The psychologist tells us that you are not really a sinner.
	- The magistrate and politician desperately tries to hone in citizens through new structures to force morality (even though they deny that morality objectively exists). 
## Application
- Take comfort in knowing that God has truly removed your transgressions forever. 
	- His work is effective and complete. 
	- From the east to the west, from sunrise to sunset. 
	- This distance is incomparable, incomprehensible, and immeasurable. 
	- Your guilt is gone, removed, and can never return. 
	- [[Rom-08#v1|Romans 8:1]]: *There is therefore no condemnation, for those who are in Christ Jesus.* 
	- David, the murderer and adulterer repented of his sin.
		- Nathan, the prophet said: *You shall not die. The LORD has put away your sin.*
		- This is the incredible grace of God. 
	- When troubles come over us, when we are tempted, when Satan the accuser spits lies at us, take comfort in the mercy of God. 
		- I am a transgressor, but I am a cleansed sinner. 
			- My sin, not in part but the whole, is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more. 
		- Therefore rejoice greatly! 
			- If Heaven rejoices over even one repentant sinner, how much more should we rejoice!
