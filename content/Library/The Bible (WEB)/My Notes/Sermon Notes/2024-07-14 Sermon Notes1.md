## ðŸ“–Bible Passage
>[!NOTE]+ Psalm 104:1-4
>Bless Yahweh, my soul. Yahweh, my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty. He covers himself with light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain. He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters. He makes the clouds his chariot. He walks on the wings of the wind. He makes his messengers winds, and his servants flames of fire. 

## Points

- What moves people to praise God? 
	- Psalm 104 is one of the loftiest and longest of the inspired Psalms. 
		- It contains the entire created universe, and all express the Creator and praise Him. It is a retelling of the creation story
		- Noticeable humankind is not explicitly mentioned, man is implied by virtue of the fact that the Psalm is written and sung by a human. 
		- We don't know the human author of this psalm. 
		- It begins and ends with a call to praise the LORD. 
			- What causes people to sing? It should be the majesty and glory of God. 
				- Even when we feel compelled to sing due to something other than God, it is because we saw something wonderful, majestic and awe inspiring. And God is the source of all these things. 
- What does v1 mean? 
	- In verse 1 we are commanded to bless the LORD for His excellencies. 
	- It is a direct vision and picture of the King on His throne and all of creation beneath Him. 
		- [[Isa-66#v1|Isaiah 66:1]]: Heaven is God's throne.  
		- The first 4 verses of this psalm picture God in His throne room, looking down upon creation
			- v4: 
			- God's throne throughout scripture
				- [[Ps-45#v6|Psalm 45:6-7]]  
				- [[Ps-47#v8|Psalm 47:8]] 
				- [[Dan-07#v9|Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14]] 
				- [[Rev-04|Revelation 4]], [[Rev-05|Revelation 5]]   
- From this psalm we learn that God's creation points to God's majesty and give Him glory: 
	- If you are uninterested in God's creation, then you should repent because you fail to recognize His glory. 
	- Calvin: Creation is the *theater* of God's glory. 
	- Jonah called himself a Hebrew, a follower of the God who made the heaven and the earth. 
- How does the author communicate this truth? 

- To whom does v1 revere? 
- What does our text teach us about the LORD? 
	- 1. He describes the throne of God, then 2. all creation under the throne. 
	- 1. the throne room: 
		- 1. God is clothed in glorious light itself. 
		- 2. Where is the throne room. 
			- *He stretches out the heavens like a curtain*
		- 3. God's chariot is the clouds
			- USA's President's chariot is Air Force One. It is impressive, yet nothing compared to God's chariot
		- 4. He makes His angels spirits, his servants flames of fire
- What does our text teach us about what the LORD does? 


## Application
- Remember that God made ALL things. 
- Realize that if you understand creation wrong, then you understand God wrong. 
	- God reveals His power, majesty, character and identity THROUGH creation: 
		- [[Rom-01|Romans 1]]: we are all without excuse because God is clearly seen in creation. 
- This psalm helps you to see the glory of Christ. 
	- How do we do that? By meditating on God's creation. 
	- Hebrews 1, and John 1 says that *through Christ God made the world*
		- Why do the NT writers keep connecting Christ with creation? It is because He is the one and true living God. 
			- We should view the creation story as the same as Christ on the earth. 
- It was Christ who ascended into Heaven, into His throne room. 
	- 1 Timothy 6:16
	- when Christ comes again, scripture says that we will see Him in the clouds. 
	- 2 marks of unbelief are to reject the rule of God and the salvation of God. 
- Repent in your sin, stand in awe of your creator and savior. Trust Him for eternal life and everlasting salvation.
