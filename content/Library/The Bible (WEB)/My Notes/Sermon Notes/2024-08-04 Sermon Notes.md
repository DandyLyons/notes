## ðŸ“–Bible Passage
>[!NOTE]+ 2 Corinthians 11:30-33
>If I mustÂ boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.

## Points
- In Corinth, there arose false apostles who claimed authority over Paul. 
- Here in this chapter, Paul was forced to defend his authority and honor, yet he does so in a very interesting way: 
	- Instead of boasting of accomplishments or pedigree, **Paul boasted of his weakness**
		- [[Jer-09#v23|Jeremiah 9:23-24]]: *Let him who glories, glory in this: that he knows Yahweh* 
			- Paul quoted this in [[1 Cor-01#v26|1 Corinthians 1:26-31]]  
- Paul listed these things as evidence of a true minister of Christ
	- 1. suffering for Christ: 
		- Review: See [[2024-07-28 Sermon Notes]] 
		- [[Matt-05#v10|Matthew 5:10-12]]: Jesus, Himself, said blessed are those who suffer for Christ
	- 2. Caring for God's people
	- 3. Leading by humbly and sincerely serving the LORD and men
		- The world's way of leading is manipulating and cajoling them to do what you want
		- In contrast, Jesus said that *the greatest is one who serves*: Matthew 18
		- Likewise Paul does not boast like others
			- [[1 Cor-02#v1|1 Corinthians 2:1-5]] Paul was not concerned with Greek oratory style, but rather in the truth of the Word of God. 
			- Paul did not come to Corinth with dominance, and power
			- Paul came to Corinth in weakness. He did this intentionally, so that they would see God's power and not his own. In fact, whatever power Paul had was not his own, but God's. 
			- Paul explicitly says he would rather boast of his weakness. [[2 Cor-11#v30|2 Corinthians 11:30]]. 
				- This is the mark of a true Christian servant. 
				- Paul *could* have boasted in his success, spiritual impact, yet he did not. 
			- Paul calls upon God, not himself, as evidence of his credential. 
				- In this way, Paul shows that God gets all the glory. 
			- Paul is a true minister of Christ because he humbly, sincerely, serves Jesus Christ in weakness.
				- There is no human explanation for the accomplishments of Paul in his ministry. It can solely be attributed to the power of God, not of human hands. 

## Application
- Do you serve others? You should. 
	- [[Phil-02#v1|Philippians 2:1-8]] *Let each of you look out, not only for your own interests, but for the interests of others*
		- Every true believer should have the mind of Christ: 
			- namely **serving** others in unity, love, joy, sincerity, humility, selflessness and peace
		- Stop serving yourself.
		- Stop serving the devil. 
		- Be reconciled to God. 
		- then you will be set free from the bondage of serving yourself. 
		- You will delight to serve the LORD and men.
