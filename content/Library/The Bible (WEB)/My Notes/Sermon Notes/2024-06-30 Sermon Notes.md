## Points

- In these words we can see the power of the Gospel and of God
- [[Ps-103#v19|Psalm 103:19]] 
- [[Ps-148#v14|Psalm 148:13]] 
- [[Jer-10#v6|Jeremiah 10:6]]: There is no one like God
- The very first part of faith is acknowledging that *God is*. But we in our rebellion want to believe *there is no God*. 
	- God is above all. There is no one like our God. 
	- Who made God? No one. God always was. 
	- He is perfectly good. What he does is always good. 
		- [[Ps-18#v30|Psalm 18:30]] *God's way is perfect*. 
		- [[Isa-46#v9|Isaiah 46:9]]: God says "I am God and there is no other."
			- God is God and we are not God. Therefore we are not qualified to question Him or His methods. 
			- but He can question us because He is God and He has made us. 
			- His Word is Law. His way is right. 
				- But this is not tyranny. Tyranny is rule by oppression.
- What is commanded in our verse today? 
	- To *bless the LORD, all His works*. 
		- God commands all of His works, which is all creation, to worship Him. 
	- What does it mean to bless the LORD? How do we bless Him? 
		- We don't improve Him or make Him better. 
		- That is not what it means to bless the LORD. 
		- To bless Him is to praise Him and to give Him glory and honor for who He is and what He does. 
		- The word bless ×‘Ö¸Ö¼×¨Ö²×›Ö´Ö£×™ includes the idea of bowing down in reverence. 
		- Why should we praise Him? 
			- Because only He is worthy of all praise. 
	- Psalm 103 is about God's grace. It is about the gifts of God. 
		- When we think about all the works of God, then this should produce praise in us toward Him. 
			- Even in the midst of our anxiety, fear and uncertainty. 
			- This is why Job worshipped God even in his calamity. [[Job-01#v20|Job 1:20]]. 
			- This is why we should not *forget all His benefits* that God has given us. [[Ps-103#v2|Psalm 103:2]] so that we would be driven to praise Him
- Notice the scope of God's works. How far does God's <u>dominion</u> reach? Only in Israel? No. In all the universe. There is nowhere, or no one in the world who is not under God's dominion. 
	- [[Dan-04#v3|Daniel 4:3]] 
	- [[Dan-06#v26|Daniel 6:26]] 
	- [[Zech-09#v10|Zechariah 9:10]]
	- [[Ps-72#v8|Psalm 72:8]] 
	- [[Ps-75#v7|Psalm 75:7]] *God is the judge. He lifts up and brings down others.* 
	- [[Rom-08#v28|Romans 8:28]] **all things** *work together for the glory of God*. Just some things? No, all things. 
		- Even those things that are distressing and confusing to us.
		- What is the proper response of every creature? It is to bless the LORD. 
- Psalm 103 ends as it began. *Bless the LORD o my soul*. 
- We must command our would to bless the LORD. 

## Application
- How should we praise Him? 
	- No poetic talent is needed here. Any expression of admiration will be accepted here.
