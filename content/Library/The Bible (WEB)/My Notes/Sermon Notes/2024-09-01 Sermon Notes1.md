## Points

- Do not despise the poor
	- [[Ps-69#v33|Psalm 69:33]] He who despises the poor despises the LORD
	- God has made all creation. Do not despise any of it, lest you despise Him who created it. 
	- [[Isa-06#v3|Isaiah 6:3]] *The whole earth is full of His glory*. 
	- This world indeed is the theater of God's glory. 
	- Heaven is but the upper story of where God's glory is. And this earth we live in is not without it's glory for God. 
- Some Christians try to remove themselves from the world. 
	- Monasticism is a vain weakness. 
	- God's world does not debase me. It is I myself who is deficient when God's world does not cause me to glorify Him? 
	- All God's works are masterpieces. 
- 1. God has prepared a suitable creature for each place. 
	- The birds make their nests in the trees
	- The stork in the cypress trees
	- the goats in the high mountains
	- the rock badgers in the cliffs
	- **Notice everything in creation has a use**.  
		- Likewise each age has its saints. 
			- Noah, Moses etc. In whatever period of history you look, God has prepared a worker for His kingdom, even in the most barren of places. 
			- God still has His elect remnant: 
				- even in the most wicked times: 
				- and fearful persecution: 
					- When Ahab killed God's prophets, God preserved a remnant for Elijah
				- and heresy: 
					- When Arius taught lies, God preserved the Church
	- Do not worry or mourn for the current crisis of this age: 
		- Every age has had its own crises, and there shall be many more, but God will still be good. 
		- Crisis comes from the Greek word for judgment or decision
			- [[John-12#v31|John 12:31-32]]
		- No man needs to say "*My trade will not permit me to be a Christian.*"
			- If that is true, then you have no business being in that trade. 
				- For God will preserve His people in every place. 
				- Just as God preserved Lot in godless Sodom. 
		- God has even preserved some true Christians even within churches which have rejected God. 
			- He has preserved His own chosen people where we are least likely to look for them. 
			- Just as the wild goats live high in the barren, dangerous mountains. 
			- [[Acts-18#v10|Acts 18:10]] God told Paul "*I have many people here in this city*"
- 2. Each creature has its appropriate place. 
	- A lion in a cage is a very different creature from a lion in the plains. 
	- Each creature looks best in their God-appointed place. 
	- Each Christian looks best in the place that God has called them. 
	- It is foolish to say *If I were placed in a different position, then I could do so much more for God.*
		- You could not do more than you can do where God placed you right now. 
		- You might think, "*I'm only an apprentice. If I were more than I could do so much more.*"
			- If you can hardly glorify God as an apprentice, then you can hardly do it as a leader. 
			- Be grateful for what you have and where God placed you, and trust that He wisely chose the right place for you. 
			- Rejoice in whatever circumstance God gives you. 
				- I might wish to have a different temperment but God made me in exactly the way that is best. 
					- Luther might have wished to have been more gentle, but that might not have led to the Reformation. 
				- The only thing I ought to change in myself is that which is **sinful**. 
				- ‚≠ê Be who God created you to be. Do not try to be someone that God didn't make you to be. 
				- Ask the LORD to mold you after His own mind. 
- 3. God provides each creature He has made with **shelter**. 
	- There are the cliffs for the rock badgers, the nests for the birds. 
	- If God has made a refuge for each animal, then He has not left man without a refuge. 
		- Nothing here on earth can fill an immortal soul. You may have profited in business, but nonetheless you will hunger for something that the world cannot satisfy. 
		- God made us to know Him. There is a fullness somewhere to meet my emptiness. 
		- It is because we are guilty that we are fearful, but Christ bore our sins, and bore God's righteous wrath, and it is He, Jesus, who is our shelter. 
			- [[Isa-40#v1|Isaiah 40:1-2]] "*Speak comfort to God's people. Her iniquity is pardoned.*" 
- 4. The **shelter** is **appropriate** for each creature. 
	- the rock cleft is suitable for the rock badger. 
	- And Christ is a suitable refuge for us sinners. 
		- It is lunacy for man to reject his savior and refuge. 
		- Just as it would be lunacy for the rock badger to reject his home in the rocks. 
		- [[Isa-01#v3|Isaiah 1:3]] "*The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib; but Israel doesn't know. My people don't consider.*" 
		- [[John-06#v37|John 6:37]] But Jesus says: "The one who comes to me, I will not cast out."
