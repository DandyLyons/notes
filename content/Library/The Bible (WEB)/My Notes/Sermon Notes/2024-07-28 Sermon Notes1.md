## Points

- God upholds, provides for, and sustains all creatures, people, and all things. 
	- This is very different from the modern view of God. 
		- The modern view of God is that their *might* be *some* idea of God *somewhere*. But whatever God is: 
			- it is not personal, specific, powerful, or relevant, necessary.
		- The modern view of God is that God didn't create us, but we created God. 
	- The natural man rejects God in all things. 
		- Rejects God, miracles, resurrection from the dead, salvation. 
	- This is in direct contrast to the Bible which reveals God: 
		- who created, upholds, governs, rules, and sustains all things. 
	- Despite all of man's discoveries we still cannot explain how life appears. 
	- See: Shorter Catechism #11: What are God's works of providence? 
- Psalm 104 teaches both [[creation]] and [[providence]]. 
- Providence means that God is intimately involved in all details of the world even today. He actively upholds, sustains and preserves all things, without fail. 
- [[Ps-104#v10|Psalm 104:10]]: *He sends springs [rivers] into the valleys. They run among the mountains. *
	- God gives us water to provide life. Yet he does not provide too much water, lest we be flooded and die. He will not allow the entire Earth to be flooded like it was in the days of Noah. [[Ps-104#v9|Psalm 104:9]]
	- Throughout all history, **rivers** have been absolutely vital to the survival of human civilization
	- [[Gen-02#v10|Genesis 2:10-14]] 
- [[Ps-104#v11|Psalm 104:11]]: *They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.*
	- God provides for his creatures. God waters His creation. He quenches their thirst. 
		- There are innumerable animals all over the Earth. And every single one of them needs water to live. And God provides for them all. 
		- Our heavenly Father cares for all these creatures. Will He not also care for you and me? 
- [[Ps-104#v12|Psalm 104:12]] *The birds of the sky nest by them [the rivers]. They sing among the branches.*
	- God provides for creation, and creation responds with joy, gladness and singing. Rejoicing. 
	- Shall we not rejoice in the LORD, who provided all these things for us? 
	- It is not right that we who are God's people should worship Him less than the birds who were not made in His image. 
- [[Ps-104#v13|Psalm 104:13]] : *He waters the mountains from his rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.*
	- God is **actively** providing for all creation. 
	- The earth is fill with the fruit of **God's** works. 
		- these are not the fruit of man's works. our works are nothing compared to His. And even what works we have, were enabled by Him. 
- [[Isa-40#v12|Isaiah 40:12-17]]   No one can compare to God: 
	- No one is as powerful as Him. 
	- or as wise as Him. 
	- No one taught Him. He did not need a teacher. Nor did He need to learn how to govern creation. 
- [[John-01#v16|John 1:16]] 
## Application
- The atheistic modern view of God is just another religion. It says *trust the science*. But we have simply replaced one God with another. 
- The more we see God and all that He has done, we only have 2 choices: 
	- we either bow before Him
	- or we rebel against Him. 
- Environmentalism says, if there is climate change then we humans need to fix it. 
	- But [[1 Kings-08#v37|1 Kings 8:37]] says *If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is;* 
- We should see God's hands in all things:
	- Stonewall Jackson: God's providence makes me sure of all things.
	- Martin Luther: It is God who provided your daily bread. 
- Trust in God to provide. 
	- Do not trust in man to provide. 
	- Nor to civil government. These things will fail you. 
- God has provided you with salvation by grace. 
	- Believe in Him and be saved. 
	- Then you will marvel at Him and be in awe at your Savior.
