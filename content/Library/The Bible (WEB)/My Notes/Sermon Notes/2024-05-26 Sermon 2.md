## Points

- So many people die. 
	- Almost 120 people die every hour
	- 165,000 every day
	- 1 person dies in the united states every 11 seconds. 
	- [[Heb-09#v27|Hebrews 9:27]] *It is man's place to die and then be judged.* 
	- [[Gen-02#v15|Genesis 2:15-17]] *The day you eat of the tree, dying, you shall die*
	- Genesis 5 tells us about the life and death of the first human ever created. 
- Death is coming for you. Only the LORD knows when you will die. How do you respond? 
- Some people: 
	- deny death. 
	- say *try to live faster, better, longer*
	- say *live for now, as long as you can*
	- say *eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die*
- We act as if this life is everything that we have, there is nothing else, and we need to cling to it. 
- What does Jesus say in our text here? His response is wholly unlike any of our thinking. 
	- He speaks of the mortality and inevitable end of us all. [[Ps-103#v15|Psalm 103:15]]
	- And yet He shows God's incredible mercy to us undeserving sinners. [[Ps-103#v17|Psalm 103:17]] 
- Perhaps you think that, although you won't live forever, *surely I don't need to think about death*.
	- God is teaching us honestly that man's life is **short in duration** and **has little effect on the world around us**. 
		- At our very brightest and best, we are nothing more than passing beauty
- Many of us today think that life is meaningless. 
	- One of the few things that gives us comfort is that others will remember us when they are gone. This is the world's way to grapple with death. It is a fickle and feeble attempt to comfort death. 
		- ‚ùì: Can you remember all the people that you know, who died? No. 
		- Graves are carved in stone, and yet after a few hundred years they are smooth and their names are lost. 
- Perhaps you have been told that you should have a bucket list, in order to maximize your experiences before you die. 
	- This too is meaningless. 
	- It does not delay, lessen or stop inevitable death. 
- Death brings some to despair because life is all they have. 
	- ‚≠ê But v17-18 promises that God's mercy is forever, and His righteousness continues for generations. 
	- His mercy is without beginning nor end. 
	- His righteousness is also unfailing. He is just and true and faithful. 
	- [[Ps-102#v28|Psalm 102:28]]
	- [[Luke-01#v49|Luke 1:49-50]] *His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation* 
	- [[Ps-90#v12|Psalm 90:12]] LORD, please teach us to number our days. 
- Where else can we go? Who else can answer the question of death? Only an everlasting and unfailing God!
	- You can not build your live in the *here and now*. You cannot afford to live for the moment, because the moment is gone. 
	- You can't rely on the world, because the world will whither away like all things. 
- we must rely on Him. 
	- We have no strength, we need to rely on His strength. 
	- His forgiving mercies. 
	- His unfailing justice. 
- ‚ùì: To whom does the LORD show his mercy? 
	- The scripture says: 1. *those who fear Him* 
	- ‚ùì: Do you fear God? 
		- Do you live with an awed awareness of Him? Are you marked with a constant awareness of His presence? That is what it means to fear the LORD. 
		- Fearful to offend Him, and therefore steering away from that which offends Him. 
	- Or are you like the fool who says *there is no God*. 
	- If we fear the LORD it changes the way we think, and feel, and act. 
		- That is a mercy from God. 
	- 2. *those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to obey his precepts*. 
		- Do you love the LORD your God with all your heart soul, mind and strength? 
		- Have you taken God's salvation on His terms, and now live as His child? 
		- Have you relied upon His promises to save you from all your sins? 
		- ‚ùì What does it mean to keep His covenant? 
			- Does that seem oppressive to you? 
				- *Does this mean I have to do what God tells me to do?* This is not the right mindset of a Christian. 
			- We should delight that God cares for us and gives us salvation. 
			- The precepts of God are not to be avoided, trimmed, changed, or even speculated about. 
			- So often we say "I do not know what God requires of me" but in reality we think "I do not **like** what God requires of me" and so we feign ignorance. 
		- ‚ùìDo you remember to do God's commandments? Do you delight in His word? 
			- It's a tragedy that there are those who call His word legalistic. 
				- We delight to do His word. They are not burdensome to us. 
					- Though yes, they cut and convict us. 
				- We want to understand His word more so that more of our hearts and minds are conformed to His image. 
			- If you are marked by His mercy then His commandments are not oppressive but liberating. 
- Count God's mercies. 
	- It is a mercy that you and I are not one of the 100 people who have died during the time of this sermon. 
	- How many stairs have you climbed and yet not fallen? 
	- Your lungs still breathe. God has held back the afflictions in your body. 
- And still, one day you and I will die. 
- What give you meaning? 
- Have you fled to God? Are you resting upon His word? Are you trusting in Jesus? 
	- If you are building here alone, you are like the man who carries all his possessions into the burning building. 
	- In Pilgrim's Progress, Christian starts his journey in the city of destruction. This is how it was for all of us. 
- God is the only antidote to despair. 
- Trust in Him.
