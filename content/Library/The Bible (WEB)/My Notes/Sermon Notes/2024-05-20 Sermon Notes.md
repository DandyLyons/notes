			- We have all hurt people. There's not a person here who hasn't. 
			- There's a lot of guilt and shame for us to overcome. 
			- sometimes it can be harder to overcome our shame, than the hurt that others placed on us.

		- [[Ephes-04#v31|Ephesians 4:31]] : *Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander be put away from you, with all malice.* 
		- 1. What area of your life are you ungrateful for?

		- In what areas of your life do you use false humility? 
		- Who have you been critical of, and who have you gossiped about? 
			- *We find it amazing that a tongue 4 inches long can destroy a man 6 feet tall*. 
	- 4. The priorities in your life
		- What you do is what's important to you. 
			- If you don't find the right things important than you won't do the right things. 
			- If you're not recovering, there's probably a large part of you that doesn't want to get better. 
		- In what areas are you not allowing God to work in your life? 
		- Is your ambition driven by God or by you? 
			- Is it driving by your pleasure? desire for approval? 
		- What in your priorities is stopping your from meeting God's priorities? 
		- What have been your priorities in the past?

		- Are you living a double life? 
			- Have you pretended to work one way in front of Christians and another way at home?
