## Points

- Labor and rest
	- 6 days of labor are both a duty and a blessing
	- Likewise the Sabbath is also both a duty and a blessing. 
- Labor is a duty
	- [[Gen-01#v26|Genesis 1:26]] *Let them have dominion*
	- [[Gen-01#v28|Genesis 1:28]]: *Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over every living thing that moves on the earth.* 
		- Fill the earth:
			- This task requires building homes, bridges, roads, 
		- Subdue the earth: 
			- God called us to subdue the earth even before the fall. 
			- God gave them all that they needed to complete this task. 
				- God did not give them an explanation of mathematics and text books. He didn't give them tools and construction. God gave them a mind, and the ability to pray and place their faith in God. 
			- God called human kind to subdue all living creatures: 
				- Not to exploit, not to harm or abuse it. 
		- Have dominion
			- The atheistic view teaches us that all animals are equal and we should treat them as such. This is not what Genesis teaches. It makes clear that God loves all His creation and yet He also created man to rule over the rest of creation. 
	- [[Gen-02#v8|Genesis 2:8]]: God put Adam and Eve in Eden
		- Why did He put them there? 
			- To rest and play? 
			- To merely observe creation?
			- No he put them there to work the creation, and take care of it. 
- Notice how the fall disrupted labor: 
	- You cannot understand what labor **is** today if you do not understand what it once **was** before the fall. 
	- [[Gen-03#v17|Genesis 3:17]]: *cursed is the ground for your sake. You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life. It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field. You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground, for you were taken out of it. For you are [[dust]], and you shall return to dust."*
		- There shall be toil all your life. 
		- There shall now be "thorns and thistles", painful impediments to your work. 
	- At the coming of Christ, this curse will be released. 
	- Until, then, this curse is the nature of labor in this life. 
	- Case Studies: 
		- Laban changed Jacob's wages 10 times. 
	- [[Ephes-04#v28|Ephesians 4:28]] : Do not steal, but instead labor, production something that is good. 
		- Why should you work? 
			- *so that you may have something to give to him who has need*
	- [[Ephes-06#v5|Ephesians 6:5-7]]  **Work as, to the LORD and not to men**
		- You are not just your master's servant, you are also the purchased bondservant of Christ. 
## Application
- Our labor: 
	- 1. Our labor should be Christ-focused activity
		- For the LORD, from the LORD, to the LORD
	- 2. Our labor should be a heart engaging activity
	- 3. Our labor should be result oriented. 
		- *so that you may provide for others*
		- *so that you may have need of nothing*
	- 4. Should be reward motivated
- If you have this biblical work ethic you will be light and salt in this crooked and perverse generation. 
- [[Prov-21#v4|Proverbs 21:4]]: *Even the plowing of the wicked man is sin.*
	- This is because he does not work for God. He works for himself.
