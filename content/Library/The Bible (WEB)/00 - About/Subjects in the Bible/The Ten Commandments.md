## Numbering the Commandments
Scripture explicitly records the amount of commandments in [[Deut-04#13|Deuteronomy 4:13]], [[Deut-10#v4|Deuteronomy 10:4]], and [[Exod-34#v28|Exodus 34:28]]. 

But interestingly, scripture never actually numbers which commandment is which number. For this reason, There has been some disagreement amongst Bible readers, historically, over which number is for which commandment.
