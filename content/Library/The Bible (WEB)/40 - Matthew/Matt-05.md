###### v1 
Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. 

###### v2 
He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, 

## The Beatitudes
###### v3 
[[#notes on 3]]
"[[Μακάριοι|Blessed]] are the poor in [[πνεῦμα|spirit]][^1], for theirs is the [[Kingdom of Heaven]]. 

###### v4 
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. 

###### v5 
Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.  

###### v6 
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled. 

###### v7 
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. 

###### v8 
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 

###### v9 
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. 

###### v10 
Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the [[Kingdom of Heaven]]. 

###### v11 
"Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 

###### v12 
Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. 

## Salt of the Land, Light of the World
###### v13 
"You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. 


###### v14 
You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden. 

###### v15 
Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. 

###### v16 
Even so, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. 

## Jesus Fulfills the Law
###### v17 
"Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill. 

###### v18 
For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. 

###### v19 
Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the [[Kingdom of Heaven]]; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the [[Kingdom of Heaven]]. 

###### v20 
For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the [[Kingdom of Heaven]]. 

## "You have heard that it was said..."
### "You shall not murder"
###### v21 
"You have heard that it was [[Exod-20#v13|said]] to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;' [[Num-35#v30|and]] 'Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.' 

###### v22 
But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to his brother, 'Raca!' will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna. 

###### v23 
"If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, 

###### v24 
leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 

###### v25 
Agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. 

###### v26 
Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny. 

### You shall not commit adultery...
###### v27 
"You have heard that it was [[Exod-20#v14|said]], 'You shall not commit adultery;' 

###### v28 
but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. 

###### v29 
If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. 

###### v30 
If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. 

### Jesus Speaks About Divorce
###### v31 
"It was also [[Deut-24#v1|Deuteronomy 24:1-4]], 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,' 

###### v32 
but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery. 

### You shall not lie...
###### v33 
"Again you have heard that it was [[Exod-20#v16|said]] to the ancient ones, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,' 

###### v34 
but I tell you, don't swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; 

###### v35 
nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 

###### v36 
Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't make one hair white or black. 

###### v37 
But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one. 

### An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth...
###### v38 
"You have heard that it was said, '[[An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.]]' 

###### v39 
But I tell you, don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. 

###### v40 
If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. 

###### v41 
Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. 

###### v42 
Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you. 

### You shall love your neighbor...
###### v43 
"You have heard that it was [[Lev-19#v18|said]], 'You shall [[love your neighbor]]  and hate your enemy.' 

[[#notes on 43]]

###### v44 
But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, 

###### v45 
that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. 

###### v46 
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same? 

###### v47 
If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same? 

###### v48 
Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

## My Notes

### notes on 3
#### "poor in spirit"
- [[#v3]]: It seems like this phrase is only used once in the bible.
- **Further reading**:
	- [What does it mean to be poor in spirit? | GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/poor-in-spirit.html)
	- [Sermon on the Mount E5: The Powerless, Grieving, and Unimportant](https://bibleproject.com/podcast/powerless-grieving-and-unimportant-beatitudes-pt-2/)  

### notes on 43
#### "hate your enemy"
- [[#v43]]: Notice that Jesus is quoting Lev. 19:18, which does say *love your neighbor* but actually DOES NOT say *hate your enemy*. Surely this is intentional. Jesus said *you have heard that it was said*, not *The Book of Leviticus says* or *The Law says*. I think that Jesus is actually trying to expose and correct an error here. We have in fact heard *hate your enemy*, but where did we hear it? Did we hear it in Lev. 19:18? Nope. In fact, I fail to find anywhere in scripture where God commands us to hate our enemy. Instead, we hear it from our friends, our families, our neighbors, and yes even ourselves. Notice that we have an innate urge to hate our enemies! It's only natural to hate our enemies, and it is anything **but** natural to love our enemies.
