- add descriptions to projects
	- explain not only the what but the why
- remove tablestakes
	- macOS, windows etc., troubleshooting, xcode
- formatting: 
	- Don't let bulletpoints wrap, it's difficult to read. 
- consider removing work experience: 
	- remove irrelevant work experience
	- rename work experience to "relevant work experience" to show that it is truncated. 
- code sharing:
	- You can say "code available upon request"
	- you can also share it in a gist
