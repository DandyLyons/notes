Hello and welcome to `Dream. Build. Ship!`, the personal website of [[Daniel Lyons]].  Here, I collect anything and everything that I find interesting, and think might be beneficial to someone else on the internet. 

Please be aware that, as a [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) and [[Digital Garden]], this site follows the philosophy of [[Learn in Public]], meaning that much of this site is a work in progress. A lot of the content here might not be "polished" and that is okay. What appears here, is a [[Second Brain]] and a [Living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document#:~:text=A%20living%20document%2C%20also%20known,is%20continually%20edited%20and%20updated.). 

But there are also sections of the site which are intended to be more "polished" and "releasable". For example the [[Blog/index|Blog]] section.

## Points of Interest
- [[Topics/Inputs/index|Inputs]]: Here are some things I'm reading. 
## About the Infrastructure of this Site
- I edit and write this site using a fantastic piece of software called [[Obsidian]]. 
	- Obsidian is a [[Markdown]] editor with **many** powerful customizations. 
	- Every file in an Obsidian vault is a simple `.md` file, which is plain text. 
- I use [[Topics/Software Development/Web Development/Static Site Generation/Quartz/index|Quartz]], a [[Static Site Generation]], to then convert those `.md` files into fully fleshed out HTML, CSS, and JS. 
	- Under the hood Quartz uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for static site generation.
