# The Age of A.I.


## Notable Quotables
>Prior programs had relied on moves conceived of, executed, and uploaded by humans - in other words, prior programs had relied on human experience, knowledge and strategy. These early programs' chief advantage against human opponents was not originality but superior processing power, enabling them to evaluate far more options in a given period of time. By contrast, [[AlphaZero]] had no proprogrammed moves, combinations, or strategies derived from human play.
