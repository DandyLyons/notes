# Elon Musk
It's difficult to separate a book from its subject, and it's even harder to separate this book from this divisive, yet inspiring man. Walter Isaacson really embraces the "fly-on-the-wall" approach to documenting his life. In doing so, I feel privileged and fascinated to sit in on conversations that I never would have had access to otherwise. Following this man's life is a rollercoaster of emotions. I find myself wanting to see more and more of his chaotic life. It's thrilling to watch, but it's certainly not a life that I'd want to live personally.
