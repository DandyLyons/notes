### 5. The Offices of the Church

#### Bishops - Overseers
- The Bible uses three words to describe the same office: 
	1. [[bishop]]
	2. [[elder]]
	3. [[pastor]] - Shepherd
	- [[1 Pet-05#v1]] : Peter uses them as synonymous
	- [[Acts-20#v28]]: 
- The pastor's primary responsibility is feeding the sheep. Preaching the Word of God. 
	- [[1 Tim-04#v1]]
	- [[2 Tim-02#v15]] : studying the Word, to rightly divide the word of truth
- The pastor must rule/lead the sheep
	- 
### 12. The Principles of Worship
- 1. Worship needs to be 100% God-centered
	- A worship that is geared to man is a worship that is not pleasing to God. 
	- What the world needs is more of God, not more of itself. 
		- not more entertainment
	- Worship should be centered on the one being worshipped. 
		- Are we worshipping God or ourselves? 
- 2. Worship needs to be **Word-centered**
	- ?: How much should worship be led by the Word and now much by the Spirit? 
		- i.e. How much should it be directed by our minds and how much by our emotions? 
		- The Bible teaches us to worship in spirit and in truth [[John-04#v24|John 4:24]]
		- Johnson: Worship should be Word centered. 
			- It is through the Word that God has revealed Himself. 
			- The Word is the sword of the Spirit: [[Ephes-06#v17|Ephesians 6:17]] 
- 3. Worship needs to be holy: 
	- 1. Worship is entering into the presence of a holy God. 
		- Sin has no place in worship. 
	- 2. Worship must be holy in expression: 
		- To view God as our "homeboy" is to not look at Him with respect and honor
	- 3. worship God in the **way** that He commanded. 
		- See Nadab and Abihu and Uziah 
- 4. Worship must not focus on the physical
	- Must not be sensual. 
	- Worship must be spiritual
	- True worship is not about stimulating our natural senses. 
- 5. Worship must be congregational: 
	- In modern churches, the lights are dimmed and the focus is put on the stage. 
	- But the focus should be on the congregation bringing glory to God. Encouraged by one another. 
		- [[Ephes-05#v19|Ephesians 5:19]] 
		- [[Col-03#v16|Colossians 3:16]]
	- Are you **listening** to a performance, or are you entering into a time and place of worship? 
- 6. Worship should be **orderly**
	- There should be a liturgy.
	- [[1 Cor-14#v40|1 Corinthians 14:40]] 
- 7. Worship must follow the [[regulative principle of worship]]
#### Deacons - Servants
- [[deacon]] 
- The deacons responsibility is to serve so that the [[elder]] has time to devote to prayer and the word of God. 
	- [[Acts-06#v2|Acts 6:2-4]]-4:
