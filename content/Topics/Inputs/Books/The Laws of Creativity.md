# The Laws of Creativity



## Takeaways


### The Laws

#### The Law of Competition


> [!quote] Measure Against Yourself
> *Do not compare yourself to others, but rather compare today's you to yesterday's. Strive to be incrementally better and you will reach new heights, untethered by the unreasonable expectations derived from comparisons to an infinite supply of others.*
> 
> **Ch. 6 of The Laws of Creativity by Joey Cofone**
#### The Law of Ideation

> [!quote] Sketch It Out
> *Take your idea and make it real, no matter how rough. The final step is only attainable by taking the first step. Once you have something to look at and adjust, you can begin the journey towards completion.*
> 
> **Ch. 13 of The Laws of Creativity by Joey Cofone**





### Creativity is not Magic

> [!quote] 
> Nearly every time I told someone I was working on this book, they said something to the effect of, "*Are you going to teach us the magic?*" The answer is a resounding *no*. Not because I can't teach creativity, but because it isn't magic.


## Notable Quotables
### The Myth that Success Must Come at a Young Age

> [!quote]
> Society inundates us with stories of young achievement. People love the idea of quick success, and the very few who are independently successful at an early age are hoisted up above the rest. Oftentimes they're even presented as the norm, suggesting that if you haven't found massive success by the time you're in your late twenties, then you're a failure.
