### Handout: Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
You need to describe your unique value in many forms, the first being a very concise sentence that makes it crystal clear to whomever you are talking to exactly what you do. I refer to this as your "Unique Value Proposition" or "UVP".
Your one sentence UVP is composed of the following elements:
• What Are You (job title)
• Where Do You Do It
• How They Benefit from You
The third part is critical to how people react to you! It's about the audience and not you.
Here's an example:
• What Are You (job title): Director of Supply Chain
• Where Do You Do It: Companies that manufacture discrete products (products assembled from parts, sometimes referred to as discrete product manufacturers)
• How They Benefit from You: Optimize their supply chain resources so they can increase revenue and reduce costs leading to higher profits
So, their UVP is:
*I am a Director of Supply Chain who helps discrete product manufacturers optimize their supply chain resources so they can increase revenue and reduce costs leading to higher profits.* 

### My Notes
- Tip: Ask an LLM what interview questions to expect
	- From the interviewers perspective
		- The truth is most interviewers will be asking an LLM for those questions as well. 
		- Interviewers are almost never trained on interviewing. 
			- They're trained by HR on what not to say so that they don't get sued. 
- How to answer a "Tell me about a time..." question (negative behavioral question)
	- Don't give any information that you were not directly asked about
	- Formats: 
		- STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Results
- Jim Rohn: *"Don't wish it was easier. Wish you were better.*
- ⭐ You should answer, **What do I do to create value?**
	- What is my **Unique Value Proposition**
- Why network? 
	- Hidden job market: There are so many jobs that are not publicly listed. (internal hires etc.)
	- You should be networking at least 50% of your time
	- You should be networking even after you have your job. 
- Using AI in your job search: 
	- Treat AI like an intern or an employee. 
		- Double check for mistakes.
	- Prompt suggestions: 
		- Use the phrase: 
			- "This is cringe"
- LinkedIn optimization: 
	- The worse thing is to be on LinkedIn with a **bad** profile. It's worse than having no profile
	- the algorithm promotes those who publish weekly
	- Keyword optimization:

	- try to post content that involves video of yourself:
