## Why I Value The Acquired Podcast
I think it's valuable to learn from the past. It's particularly valuable to learn from people who tried to do a really hard thing. It's inspiring to learn about their [[Topics/Success/index|successes]]. It's cathartic and encouraging to learn about their failures. And it is always informative.
