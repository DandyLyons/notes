## Why I love this movie
- Performance. Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar in this movie is absolutely captivating. 
- Anti-war message. This is a movie where neither side is right and neither side is wrong. Both sides are merely trying to protect their loved ones and unfortunately that is leading them to conflict with each other. 
- Tension. Man, does this movie have so much tension. 
- Look at the first and last shot of the movie... nuff said.
