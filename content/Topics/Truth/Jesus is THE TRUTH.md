## Outline on the Subject of Truth

### The Fundamental Question of Truth
- Pontius Pilate's question to Jesus, "What is truth?", is a profound and important question
- The search for truth is the fundamental basis of all questions
- Asking a question presupposes that there is truth that is not yet fully grasped

### Two Interpretations of "What is Truth?"
1. What are the contents of truth?
   - Distinguishing between what is true and what is false
   - Identifying the facts and realities that constitute truth

2. What is the nature of truth?
   - Exploring the properties, attributes, and qualities of truth
   - Examining common statements about truth, such as "finding your own truth"

### The Contradictions of "Multiple Truths"
- The idea of "your truth" and "my truth" is logically contradictory
- If there were multiple, conflicting truths, then there would be no truth at all
- The nature of truth implies that there can only be one, objective truth

### The Significance of Jesus as the Truth
- Jesus declared himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life"
- This means that truth is not external to Jesus, but is embodied in him
- Anything that is truly true must be consistent with and grounded in Jesus, who is the ultimate source of truth.

Let's talk about the subject of truth. So in the gospels we see that Pontius Pilate asks Jesus a very interesting and important question. Perhaps the most important question. He asks Jesus what is truth. Why would I call that the most important question? Well, because unconvinced that that question is the fundamental basis of every question that you could possibly ask. After all, what is a question if not a search for truth? Isn't that the entire point of asking questions? The entire point of asking questions is there's something that I don't know and I want to find out what that thing is. And also I want to find out what actually is. Otherwise, why would I ask the question? I guess a little bit more complicated than that, especially because in our own biases in our own lack of humility and many other character defects, very often we don't actually want the truth. The truth is quite uncomfortable, but at least in some sense, if we didn't really want the truth at least in part, then why would we ask a question? In fact, I'm convinced that the very act of asking a question presupposes that there is such a thing as truth. And that I do not entirely hold the truth. I am lacking the truth at least in part in some way. Otherwise, there would be no reason to ask a question. I'm thinking of a counter example right now, because sometimes we actually do ask questions for other reasons like hypothetical questions or even more rhetorical questions. And a rhetorical question is not asked in order to find a truth that you don't have rather a rhetorical question. It's asked so that I can use it on illustrative points. Right? The rhetorical question, however, the rhetorical question is not for the purpose of the speaker to find a truth that they don't already have. But I will say there is still a search for truth. It is still presupposing a truth that is not grasped. But the difference is the person, a rhetorical question, is asked by the speaker so that the hearer of the question can find a truth that they don't grasp. That's the reason why we ask rhetorical questions. So in that sense, even a rhetorical question is still a search for truth and presupposes that there is a truth that has not yet been grasped by some part. Okay, so let's go back to Pontius' pilot. He asked what is truth. And again, I think this is one of the meatballs in the court question. He's filled with irony because he's actually looking at truth based on the fact that Jesus himself declared himself to be the way the truth. And the life, Jesus is the truth. The truth not only comes from them, he doesn't just merely go with the truth. Truth is not external to Jesus as if it's something that grasps or foul. It's not a mere quality of them if he is the truth. Right? Anything that could be called true is only true in so far as it is consistent with them. Right? Well, we'll expand on that. But there is no truth that is a part of Jesus Christ. He is the truth. Right? And that's the irony is that Pontius' pilot is asking what is truth and it's right in front of him. He doesn't even realize it. But furthermore, let's consider a formal. Why did Pontius' pilot ask that question? What does Pontius' pilot mean when he's asking what is truth and why is it what do you mean? What do you and I tend to mean when he asks the question what is truth? Right? Well, at least for me, when I ask what is truth, I'm asking one of two questions. And both of these questions are important and interesting. And they're actually kind of very different questions. One, I might be asking what is truth in the sense of why is truth? Right? And I look at something and I don't know if it's true or if it's false. By asking what is truth, I'm asking is this thing true or is it false? Right? Is this thing a part of truth or falsehood? Right? Or non-truths or is it untrue or kind of insmanage? But so in other words, sometimes we only ask what is truth and what we're really asking is what are the contents of truth? Right? If you imagine truth as a box, there are some things that are in the box and there are some things that are outside the box, you also call it a ben-diadamant, right? Some things are true, like it is true, plus two equals four. So that would be a fact, that would be a thing that is in the box that we call truth. But there is also, there is also some things that are outside of the box, like two plus two equals five. That is not true, that is not a fact, that is not something that categorizes truth with the box. Truth, right? So that's the first question that I see, the first way that you can interpret the question, what is truth? There is actually a second way, which is not so much what is the contents of truth, but it is asking, what is the nature of truth? Right? What do we know about truth? If we look at truth as a thing, what can we observe about truth? What are its properties? What are its attributes? What do we know about truth? And also what do we know are qualities that truth does not? Right? So this will be probably one of the major subjects, if not the majority subject of this explanation of this book on truth that I'm writing. But I want to know what is the nature of truth? Right? And so just some examples of some things that we should explore further. Some will tell you statements like, "Oh, you need to find your truth, follow your truth." Now, a statement like that may not seem very controversial, but I really think it should be. I really think that a statement like that should be far more comfortable. Why? The statement "follow your truth" implies, "Well, one, it explicitly says that you possess the truth, you own the truth." It's not just truth that you found that you grasped through observation, logic, and reasoning. It is truth that you own it in fact, then it implies that you determined that truth. You decided what was true and what was not true. But furthermore, it seems to imply that there is more than one truth, that you have your truth, and I have my truth, and they have their truth, and there is a plurality. A diversity of truth. And I would argue very strongly against that. That statement, "Do I have my truth, more than one truth?" It is utterly nonsensical, utterly contrary, and in fact, to believe in multiple truths. It flies in the face of the very nature of truth itself, if there is supposedly more than one truth, then in fact there is no truth, because the very existence of a multiple truth is a contradiction. Right? It doesn't make sense. In any sense.
