Title: Exploring the Multifaceted Truth of Scripture

In the journey of faith, one foundational belief among Protestant Christians is the unwavering truth of Scripture. We affirm wholeheartedly that every word within the Bible is true. Amen. Hallelujah. It's a beautiful affirmation, isn't it? But perhaps, it's time for a deeper exploration.

Yes, all Scripture is undeniably true, and I don't intend to dispute that fact. However, I propose that we refine our understanding of what it means for Scripture to be true. It's not enough to simply say it's true; we must delve into the manner in which it holds truth. This might sound controversial, but bear with me.

Consider the parables of Jesus. Are they true? Absolutely. But in what sense? Take the Good Samaritan, for instance. Was there an actual historical figure who embodied that narrative? Likely not. Yet, the essence of the parable, the message it conveys, is undeniably true. This highlights the need to discern the different layers of truth within Scripture.

Now, let's delve into the enigmatic book of Revelation. Its passages often pose challenges in interpretation, leading to diverse understandings. Some argue for a purely metaphorical interpretation, while others insist on a literal reading. But what about the golden lampstands and stars? Even within a literal interpretation, Revelation itself suggests metaphorical elements. This complexity invites us to explore the multifaceted nature of truth within Scripture.

Turning to the book of Job, we encounter a narrative rich in theological dialogue. Job's friends offer flawed perspectives, later corrected by God Himself. So are the words of Job's friends true? Well, God explicitly says that they are not true. But their words are in the Bible. So then does this mean that not all of scripture is true? Certainly not! Those words are true, we just need to clarify *in what way* are they true. The *substance* of the words are true. It is true, that Job had friends who said these things to him. But the *content* is not true. The theological claims that Job's friends made were not true, and that is why God corrected them.[^1] 

Indeed, Scripture is a rich tapestry of truth, but it requires careful discernment. We cannot apply a one-size-fits-all approach to its interpretation. Instead, we must navigate the complexities, understanding each passage within its unique context.

In conclusion, the challenge lies not in affirming the truth of Scripture, but in understanding its manifold expressions of truth. As we delve deeper, we uncover layers of meaning and wisdom that enrich our faith journey. So, let's embrace the task of rightly dividing the word of truth, seeking not just affirmation, but understanding.

## Transcript
In Scripture we say that we as Protestant Christians believe wholeheartedly that all Scripture is true. Amen. Hallelujah. That's wonderful. All Scripture is true. I don't at all want to disagree with that statement in the slightest. All of Scripture is true. There is no part of it that is not true. However, I think that we need to refine that statement. Yes, it's all true. But it is not enough for us to merely say that it's true. We need to qualify and clarify what is the manner in which it is true. Exactly how is it true? And that already may be a quite controversial thing for me to say. So let me explain and elaborate further why that is such an important distinction to make in question to ask. Let's look at a couple of examples. One, let's look at the many, many, many parables that Jesus taught. Right? No. Is all of the Bible true? Yeah. But is it true that there was a Good Samaritan? Well, that question is a different question. And that we should look at more deeply. In fact, it would not be uncontroversial to say that no, there was not an actual living historical person who was the Good Samaritan who found someone bleeding and dying on the side of the road. Those events did not physically, historically happen. So it would not be true to say that the story of the Good Samaritan was a historical account. Does that mean that the story is not true? No. But what it means is that we need to clarify and understand exactly how was it true and how was it not true. Again, it was, it's not true in the sense that it was a historical account. It is true in the sense that Jesus did actually say those words. He did actually teach the parable of the Good Samaritan. It also is true in the sense that the purpose of the parable was to teach an important lesson. And that lesson that Jesus teaches is also true. The conclusions of that lesson, the message of that lesson, the theological truths of it, those are all true. So just because something is not true in one particular sense does not mean that it is untrue in every sense. The Good Samaritan is true. But again, it's not true as a historical account. It is true as a parable and as a message. Let's look further at the book of Revelation. Now, there are many examples of passages in the book of Revelation that are quite difficult to exegete. Quite difficult to get the proper understanding of what the text means. And so because of that, we have different understandings and interpretations. There's a lot of disagreement on what Revelation means. But because of that, we can see that there's disagreement on how we should interpret the book of Revelation. I'm just going to show you two different approaches that have been used. I'm not going to expand just at this moment on exactly what I think is the right way. But I will share one way that I am convinced strongly is not the right way to interpret it. On the one hand, you have some people who say that the book of Revelation is entirely metaphor. It's not to be taken literally. It is not completely accurate. These are just images. And even that, there can be disagreement about the images. Okay, they're images, but are they images pointing to actual things? Are they not true in the literal sense, but are they true in the metaphorical sense? Are these metaphors that are pointing to actual truths? Or is it all just meaningless, flowery images? So even that is already two different opinions of interpretation. In fact, we can further subdivide those into even more distinctions. But let's not get too deep into that just now. And then let's look at another interpretation, which is very different. On the other hand, we can say actually, none of it is metaphor. All of it is literal. All of it is literally true. So when we read passages about the dragon swallowing up a third of the stars from the sky, we are to interpret that as literally, there is literally a dragon, a large reptilian animal that went up into the sky and swallowed up a third of all the stars. And we could go on and on and on. But that these are not symbols. These are actual events. Now, we can speculate and then have different opinions on these things. But that's not what I'm going to do right now. I'm going to merely point to something that is actually in scripture, right? In the book of Revelation, it says that there it talks about seven golden lampstands, right? This is in the first chapter, right? So let me find it real quick. So at the beginning of the letter, John sees seven spirits and seven golden lampstands. And then in verse 20, Jesus speaks to him and explicitly says to him, quote, "As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches." So why is that important? It is important because if you believe that all of the book of Revelation is literal, is not merely a metaphor, is not merely an image, but is literal. There literally is seven golden lampstands and seven stars. Well, then even by that framework, even by that belief of how we ought to interpret the book of Revelation, you are literally told in the text right here that these seven lampstands literally represent the seven churches, right? He says the seven lampstands are the seven churches. And he says the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. Do you see what I'm trying to say here? What I'm saying is that even if you have a very, very narrow definition of truth within the Bible as the only thing that is true in the Bible is the literal interpretation. Well, the literal interpretation tells you actually this is metaphorical. And so you cannot be consistent if you hold to the view that we should only look at Scripture, in particular this passage in Revelation, if you look at them only as literal. So then the point is that they're explicitly is metaphorical language in Revelation. And if we look throughout Scripture, there's actually metaphorical language throughout all of the Scriptures, the Old Testament and the New Testament. So again, this comes back to my point. We need to consider what is the manner in which Scripture is true. Yes, again, Scripture is true, right? And Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. And all of the word comes from Jesus because Jesus is the Word. But even though that is the case, we have to look deeper and understand in what way is this true. We have to have not just receive the truth, but to actually gain understanding of the truth. Let me share with you one more example. In the book of Job, normally people just talk about the beginning and the end of Job, and they don't talk about the middle and the truth is the middle is kind of hard to talk about for a variety of reasons. But we have the story of Satan comes to God, and God says to Satan, "Well, look at my servant Job and see how faithful he is." And then Satan makes the accusation, "Well, he's only faithful because you have blessed him so much." And I bet if he took away all those blessings and if he brought hardship upon him, he would curse you and he would stop serving you faithfully. And so God actually gives Satan permission to do that. And Satan brings a lot of pain on Job, and he takes away a lot of blessings from Job. Job, basically all of his family members die. All of his possessions are lost. And then he's covered in disease and he's extremely heartbroken. And then in the middle, we have almost 50 chapters of his friends consoling him. And then this consolation becomes not so friendly and it becomes an ongoing back and forth debate between Job and his three friends. And it's a dialogue, really. And then finally you have God who shows up at the end and just kind of ends the argument. And then Job is blessed by God. That's the basic layout of the plot points of the story of Job. Now why do I bring this up? Well, again, here's my question. Is all of scripture true? Well, yes. Of course it is. Okay, well, let's look at the middle portion of the book of Job. Pick almost any chapter in there. And some of the chapters are the words of Job. Some of the chapters are the words of Job's friends. Are those chapters true? Well, we know explicitly that they are not true, at least not true in every sense of the word. And the reason why we know that is because God himself rebukes Job's three friends. And even has kind of sort of a, well, yeah, he has an explicit rebuke of Job as well, right? And God explicitly tells Job's three friends that what you said is not true. Okay, so let's return to the question. If we look at the middle portion of the book of Job, is it true? And the answer is, yes, it is true. But in what specific way is it true? Okay, is it true in the sense that the theological statements made by Job's friends are true? Well, no, no, it's not true in that sense because God himself explicitly declares that they're not true and shows that they're not true. Okay. Maybe some of those statements aren't contradicted by God, but at least quite a sizable majority of it is contradicted by God. So there's more for us to explore within that. But what we can say confidently is that large portions of the book of Job are, in fact, theologically incorrect. And we know that they are theologically incorrect because God himself said that they were theologically incorrect at the end of the book. Okay. So they're not true in that sense. So in what sense are they true? Well, they are true in the sense that Job's three friends actually said those things. And they are also true in the sense that those chapters within the context of the entire book of Job form a lesson and a message from God to us. And the entire message of the book of Job is true and is profitable for teaching and reproof, right? And is given from God to us. The middle chapters out of context are not true, but within the context of the entire scope of the book of Job, they're very true, right? And they have something valuable to teach us. They teach us that Job's friends were wrong in their belief and understanding about God. And likewise, that should call us to question, hey, maybe there's some things that I believe that are wrong and incorrect. Maybe I should seek God to rebuke and reprove and correct me, correct my incorrect understanding. So all of this is just an introduction to the concept that yes, all of the Bible is true, but it behooves us to look at and consider what is the way in which it is true. And as we find, there's not a simple answer to that. And there's not a one size fits all answer to that that we can apply to the entirety of the Bible in each individual book. And indeed, even in each individual passage, there are nuances. There are sections that are true in one way and not true in another way. And this is the goal, the task, and the fruit of our labor that we have to look forward to, that as we search out Scripture, we can find out not just that Scripture is true, but that we can understand in what specific way is it true. So that's what we have to look forward to. Lastly, I want to leave you with this thought, I think quite possibly this is at least a part of I think what Paul is talking about when he says the phrase rightly divide the word of truth. It's all the word of truth, all of it, but it needs to be divided. Why does it need to be divided? I think this is part of why. It's because we have to understand not just that it is true, but we have to understand in what way is it true.

[^1]: It is worth mentioning that there exists some debate about the Book of Job. Some see it as an actual historical event, while others see it as an allegorical story which didn't actually happen in history. Neither of these views threaten the infallible truth of scripture in any way. Even if these events never took place, it doesn't negate the truth of the message that is taught in the story.
