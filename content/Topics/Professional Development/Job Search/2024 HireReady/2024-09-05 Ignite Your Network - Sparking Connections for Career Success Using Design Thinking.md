- Networking is really helpful
- Why networking matters (and why it's actually exciting)
	- You often feel like you don't have much choice, control, connection, creativity, trust, growth
	- Networking helps with all of these. 
	- Trust: Networking allows others to establish trust for you
		- They vouch for you
- Your networking superpower is **authenticity**: 
	- the more you try to be someone else, you end up in the wrong job
- **Design thinking**
	- A problem solving methodology from the design

	- Similar to Agile
	- Step 1: Empathize: 
		- Understanding others **and** yourself
		- *Who are you?*
			- Present. Past. Future.

		- *What is important to you now in your work/career?* 
		- *What does your community care about?* 
		- *What do you stand for?* (values)
		- *Who are you? How can you best explain that to your network?* 
		- What type of networking suits you best? 
	- Step 2: Define
		- Clarify your networking targets? 
		- What type of people will you connect with?
		- Who do you know in each type, or category? 
		- What are you asking for? 
		- Why do you think this type of person can help?

			- a tool to keep track of people you know in your network
			- similar to a CMS
			- This is an **ongoing process**. It should be done periodically, even when you are not actively job seeking. 
	- Step 3: ideate
		- Ask yourself *Who might I know*
	- Step 4: Prototype
		- Experiment
		- Start with people who are friendly with you
		- Just DO it. 
		- Track results - what worked? What didn't? 
	- Step 5: Test and Repeat
		- make it a daily habit
		- keep track of your progress
		- check and adjust
		- keep your network alive
		- be of service to others

- What to ask for? 
	- Make it easy for someone to say yes.
		- Offer scheduling times
			- try using Calendly or similar tools. 
	- Make it genuine
	- Ideas of what to ask for: 
		- An update, a thank you, an intro request, an appreciation, an offering, ask if you can take them out for coffee or beer
- 

- Introverted? Try this: 
	- Ask someone you know if they can introduce you to someone you don't know
- Overcoming networking challenges: 
	- Nervous? 
		- focus on where is the joy? What's in it for you. 
	- Made a mistake? 
		- focus on what did you learn? 
	- Procrastinating? 
		- focus on what will you gain if you do reach out.
