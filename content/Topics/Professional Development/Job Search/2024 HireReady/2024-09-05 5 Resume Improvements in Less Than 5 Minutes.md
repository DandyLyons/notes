## Speaker Background
- Bogdan switched from film/tv to startups/tech
	- Longest job search: 14 months
	- Asked recruiters and career coaches for tips 
- Recruiters only spend 10-30 seconds on average scanning resumes
	- Resumes should be glanceble
- On average, job receive 250 applications, and interview 4-5 applicants
- a Resume that isn't scannable is 60% less likely to receive an interview
	- must be scannable by ATS and human recruiter
- On average, recruiters review about 100-200 applications per day. 

- A successful resume has 11 components
	- today we'll talk about 5 of them. 
- the #1 mistake of resumes
	- **the recruiter problem:** Recruiters don't have much time
		- A day in the life of a recruiter: 
			- Recruiters attend meetings, phone screen applicants etc. 
			- They actually have very little time to read resumes. 
			- Often overworked and underpaid. 
		- Have a new mindset: "It's not about me. It's about them"
		- Be concise
- Balancing your bullet points
	- 5 types of bullet points
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.12.45 AM.png]]
		- Built
		- Lead
		- Managed
		- Collaborated
		- Improved
	- Try color coding bullet points
- New mindset: "Show your full **range** of experience, **not** your entire experience"
- the **Bullet Point formula**
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.16.08 AM.png]]
	- Power verb: 
		- e.g. built, improved, led
	- Method/Skill: 
	- Result: 
		- What if my accomplishments are not **measurable**? If I don't have metrics. 
			- It is okay to estimate. It doesn't have to be exact. 
			- Try to regularly write measurable results while you have the job (before you forget). 
- The **And** Technique: 
	- A technique to write more concisely
	- Cmd+F and look for `and`. 
	- The rule is **you should only have one and per sentence**
		- If you have more, then it means you are trying to say too much in one sentence of bullet point. 
- Word Count: 
	- **Forget page count. Use word count instead**
	- The ideal word count for a resume is **500 words**
		- <u>early to mid career</u>: 350-500 words
		- <u>15+ years experience</u>: 500-600 words
	- When you increase word count, you are decreasing the probability that they will see your best assets. 
- New mindset: "Your resume is the movie trailer, not the entire movie. Less is more."
- Resume Summary: Adding Personality
	- Challenge #3; Being human on paper
	- A resume is a dual purpose document
		- Helps get an interview
		- Once you've gotten the interview, the resume helps create a connection with the hiring manager / interviewer
	- Resume summary
		- 1. **Original**: Be unique. Not many people could write this. 
		- 2. Add value: Don't just be a synopsis of the rest of the summary
		- 3. **Informal**: 
		- Example: 
			- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.26.15 AM.png]]
			- **beat Mark Zuckerberg at hockey** was a conversation starter and interesting ice-breaker. 
			- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.28.01 AM.png]]
- Takeaway: **Human beings hire human beings.**
- This talk is not about

- ATS issues
	- ATS's are notoriously bad at parsing text boxes. 
	- See: [How to Beat the ATS in 25 Minutes | The Ultimate Guide](https://growthhackyourcareer.com/how-to-beat-the-ats/) 
	- No matter what, your resume should be friendly for the human being (rather than only for ATS). 
- It should be possible to customize a resume and cover letter to a job in under 5 minutes. 
	- Try to be modular
- Entry-level resumes: 
	- [Zero to Hired: How To Get a Job With (little or) No Experience](https://growthhackyourcareer.com/get-job-with-no-experience/) 
- Volunteer experience: 
	- List it on LinkedIn
	- Only put on resume if it's relevant
- Career gap: 
	- Address the career gap. 
		- Make sure you mention it. Not mentioning it forces the recruiter to guess. 
		- add a one line explanation
- Career change: 
	- These tend to be much more complicated than.
