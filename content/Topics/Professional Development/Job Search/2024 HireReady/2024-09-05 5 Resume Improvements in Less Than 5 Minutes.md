## Speaker Background
- [02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=151&v=aRN3h1V3NIs) 
- Bogdan switched from film/tv to startups/tech
	- Longest job search: 14 months
	- Asked recruiters and career coaches for tips 

### Job Facts or Myths
- [05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=310&v=aRN3h1V3NIs): **Recruiters only spend 10-30 seconds on average scanning resumes**
	- Resumes should be glanceble
- [06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=397&v=aRN3h1V3NIs) On average, job receive 250 applications, and interview 4-5 applicants
- [07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=449&v=aRN3h1V3NIs:  a Resume that isn't **scannable** is 60% less likely to receive an interview
	- must be scannable by ATS (structured in a way that automated systems can parse)
	- and human recruiter (must be concise, and glanceable)
- [08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=502&v=aRN3h1V3NIs) On average, recruiters review about 100-200 applications per day. 

- [09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=549&v=aRN3h1V3NIs) A successful resume has 11 components
	- today we'll talk about 5 of them. 
### the #1 mistake of resumes: Taking too much time
- [09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=585&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
- **the recruiter problem:** Recruiters don't have much time
	- A day in the life of a recruiter: 
		- Recruiters attend meetings, phone screen applicants etc. 
		- They actually have very little time to read resumes. 
		- Often overworked and underpaid. 
	- <u>Have a new mindset</u>: "*It's not about me. It's about them*"
		- **Be concise**

### Bullet Points
- Don't show everything: 
	- **Filter out** what is irrelevant to the recruiter 
- Balancing your bullet points
	- There are really only **5 types of bullet points**
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.12.45 AM.png]]
		- **Built**
		- **Lead**
		- **Managed**
		- **Collaborated**
		- **Improved**
	- ==Try color coding bullet points== to see if you have a good balance of the 5 types: [12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=732&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
		- (This exercise is for yourself. You don't necessarily keep the colors on the final resume.)
- **New mindset**: "Show your full **<u>range</u>** of experience, **not** your entire experience"
### the **Bullet Point formula**
- [14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=882&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
- 1. **Power verb**, 2. **Method/Skill**, 3. **Result**
- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.16.08 AM.png]]
- 1. **Power verb**: 
	- e.g. built, improved, led
- 2. **Method/Skill**: 
	- How did you accomplish this? 
- 3. **Result**: 
	- Include the results as measurable metrics
	- What if my accomplishments are not **measurable**? If I don't have metrics. 
		- It is okay to estimate. It doesn't have to be exact. 
		- Try to regularly write measurable results while you have the job (before you forget). 
	- e.g. *resulting in*, *leading to*, 

## How to Shorten Bullet Points
[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1017&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
- <u>The **And** Technique</u>: (How to tell if your bullet point is too long)
	- A technique to write more concisely
	- Cmd+F and look for "`and`". 
	- ‚≠ê The rule is **you should only have one "and" per sentence**
		- If you have more, then it means you are trying to say too much in one sentence of bullet point. 

## Word Count
[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1118&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
- Word Count: 
	- **Forget page count. Use word count instead**
	- The ideal word count for a resume is **<u>500 words</u>**
		- <u>early to mid career</u>: 350-500 words
		- <u>15+ years experience</u>: 500-600 words
	- When you increase word count, you are decreasing the probability that they will see your best assets. 
- New mindset: "Your resume is the movie trailer, not the entire movie. Less is more." [21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1281&v=aRN3h1V3NIs) 

## Resume Summary: Adding Personality
[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1316&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
- Challenge #3; Being human on paper
- A resume is a dual purpose document
	- Helps get an interview
	- Once you've gotten the interview, the resume helps create a connection with the hiring manager / interviewer
- Resume summary: [23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1416&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
	- 1. **Original**: Be unique. Not many people could write this. 
	- 2. Add value: Don't just be a synopsis of the rest of the summary
	- 3. **Informal**: 
	- Example: 
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.26.15 AM.png]]
		- **beat Mark Zuckerberg at hockey** was a conversation starter and interesting ice-breaker. 
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10.28.01 AM.png]]
- Example of a **boring** summary without personality: 
	- "*Experienced project manager with 5 years experience, self-driven, self-starter, workin gin the gaming industry for 10 years.*"
- Takeaway: **Human beings hire human beings.**

## Q & A
[31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1919&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)

### Metrics
[31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1919&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
- What if I don't have measurable accomplishments? We don't measure things. 
	- **It is okay to estimate.**
	- How many customers would you say come through the store? How many do you help a day? 
	- It helps to have at least 3 or 4 numbers on your resume. 

### ATS 
- ATS issues: [35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2121&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
	- ATS's are notoriously bad at parsing text boxes. 
	- See: [How to Beat the ATS in 25 Minutes | The Ultimate Guide](https://growthhackyourcareer.com/how-to-beat-the-ats/) 
	- No matter what, your resume should be friendly for the human being (rather than only for ATS). 

### Quicker Resume Editing
[36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2216&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
- Your resume should be friendly for the human being no matter what.[^1]
- It should be possible to customize a resume and cover letter to a job in **under 5 minutes**. 
	- **Try to be modular**

### How to Fill In Missing Areas
- [38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2295&v=aRN3h1V3NIs) Q: How do recruiters feel about resumes with freelancer experience? 
	- A: Recruiters like freelancers so long as the they show the results.
- Entry-level resumes: [39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2346&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
	- [Zero to Hired: How To Get a Job With (little or) No Experience](https://growthhackyourcareer.com/get-job-with-no-experience/) 
- Volunteer experience: [39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2387&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
	- List it on LinkedIn
	- Only put on resume if it's **relevant**
- Career gap: [40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2438&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
	- Don't leave the career gap unmentioned
		- Put a section with a name like "**Career Gap**", and a very short explanation like "**Took some time off to care for aging parent.**"
		- **Make sure you mention it.** Not mentioning it forces the recruiter to guess. 
		- add a one line explanation
- Career change: [41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2507&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
	- These tend to be much more complicated than other job situations.
		- Expect 2-3 months extra to job search if you are doing a career change. 
	- [43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2591&v=aRN3h1V3NIs) Career change resumes: 
- Certifications: [45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2735&v=aRN3h1V3NIs)
	- Worthwhile?:
		- Yes if it is something that "actually means something". 
		- It comes in more handy in your cover letter. 
- **Try this:** Hand your resume to someone and only give them 10 seconds to look at it. 
	- Then ask "What do you remember from this resume?"

[^1]: You shouldn't make a resume that is optimized for the ATS while being bad for a human to read.
