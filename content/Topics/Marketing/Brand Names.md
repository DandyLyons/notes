For better or worse, branding is a necessary part of modern life. If you have a business you need a brand. Even if you don't have a business, your social media profiles are effectively your personal brand. Even if you don't use social media, the internet is a gigantic place, and it costs virtually nothing for someone to impersonate you through their branding. 

At the end of the day, a brand is simply another way of describing your reputation. If you want to interact with the world, then you need to care about your brand. 

## Helpful Tools
Whenever I have an idea of something I might want to create, sooner or later, I do a search of my brand name idea on all the major places. URL domains[^2], social media user names, App Store apps[^1]. But this process is tedious, time consuming, and it requires me to download and use social media apps that I can't stand. Thankfully I've found a few tools that make this **so** much easier:

# Footnotes

[^1]: Even if your idea is not an app, you should still search the major app stores. If a similar brand is being used somewhere it could cause future headaches. 
[^2]: I've always been worried about "URL snipers". Companies that wait for someone to attempt to open a particular URL domain. Once they do, they can see that there is demand for it. Then they buy it cheap, and resell it at astronomical prices.
