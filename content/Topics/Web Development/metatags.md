## How meta tags work
### **Title Tag**

Title tag is an HTML element that specifies the title of a web page. Search engines display the title tag on the search result page.

Title tag is important for SEO and social sharing, you should use it to describe the content of the page.

**Best practices:** Keep your title under 60 characters.

<title>Product Hunt – The best new products in tech.</title>

### **Description Tag**

Meta description is an HTML element that provides a brief summary of a web page. It is just as important as your title tag for optimizing your search presence.

Search engines will read your meta description and display it in the search results.

**Best practice:** Keep your description between 155 - 160 characters.

```html
<meta name="description" content="Product Hunt is a curation of the best new products, every day. Discover the latest mobile apps, websites, and technology products that everyone's talking about.">
```
