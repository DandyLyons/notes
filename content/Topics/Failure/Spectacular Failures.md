Failure is an inevitable, necessary part of the journey of life. While it may be heartbreaking, it is unavoidable. But we can and we must learn from failures. From our own failures, and those of others. This page is dedicated to those who failed spectacularly. For one reason or another, each of these people should be admired (even if success is not the reason).
