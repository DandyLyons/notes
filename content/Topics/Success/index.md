## Myths of Success
- Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps: 
	- [I've Had This Backwards for 36 Years! ðŸ’Œ - YouTube](https://youtu.be/N_HTms9QLCo?feature=shared&t=369) by [[McGuire Brannon]]. 
		- McGuire makes the case that we have underestimated the role of [[Luck]] in Success. 
- [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias): 
	- We have a tendency to look at successful people and wonder *"how did they become successful and how can I do the same things"*. This is not a bad practice but it is not without its flaws. In particular, we neglect to notice that for every successful person there were many others who were unsuccessful while pursuing essentially the same endeavor. We are missing the valuable insights and lessons from the failures.
- [[Success is not a straight line]]
