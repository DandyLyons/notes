> What would you do if you didn’t know that it’s “impossible”? 

Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson were seniors in High School when they accomplished something that had stumped mathematicians for hundreds of years, they came up with a proof for the Pythagorean Theorem using trigonometry. How did they do this? A lot of hard work and perseverance. Oh and one more crucial ingredient: they didn't know that it's "impossible". 

Nobody told them that they couldn't do this. Nobody told them that mathematicians had tried and failed to do this for thousands of years. 

They attended St. Mary's academy, a school that teaches young black women that they can do anything, and they have an impressive track record to back it up. Their school has raised many prominent black women in history. 


## Good Will Hunting
Consider also ____ , the inspiration for the movie [[Goodwill Hunting]]. One day, he came late to a university lecture. Anxious to catch up on his work, he copied the professor's lengthy math problem onto a sheet of paper to complete at home. A few days later, he returned to his teacher. "Sorry, this homework is late." he said to his professor as he turned it in. Dismissive, the professor barely acknowledged him. A few days later, someone knocked on his dorm room door. It was his professor. "Did you really do this?" he said pointing to the sheet of paper. "Yes. Why do you ask?" the student said. The professor replied "You've just made history."

You see the math problem on the board, was not homework. In fact, the professor was demonstrating a math problem that had never been solved before, because it was "impossible". But the student never knew that because he came late to class. 

## Landing rockets is impossible
The most expensive car in the world is the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail[^1], which costs over $28 million. Now imagine you saved up for a car that costs many times more than that, drove it only once, and then destroyed it. This is essentially the way that almost every rocket has worked since the beginning of space exploration. It is eye wateringly expensive, which begs the question, *why don't we just reuse the rocket*? The answer is *because it's "impossible"*. At least, that's what everyone was told. 

On December 21, 2015 , SpaceX first successfully landed its Falcon 9 rocket. Now the  "impossible" has become routine. In 2023 alone, SpaceX successfully launched 96 times. 

How did they do this? Again. The answer is a whole lot of hard work. But also, Elon Musk refuses to use the word impossible.

## impossible vs. infeasible vs. impractical
==There are few things in the world that are truly impossible.== In fact, most things that we call impossible are not actually impossible. Rather, they are infeasible or impractical. Therefore, it’s very important that we learn and develop a way to determine the difference between impossible, infeasible, and impractical. 

The key differences between impossible, infeasible, and impractical are:Impossible means something that cannot be done or achieved under any circumstances or conditions. It is an absolute state of being unable to occur or be realized.Infeasible means something that is not possible to do given the existing constraints, limitations or circumstances. It suggests being unworkable or unachievable within the current parameters.Impractical means something that is unwise, unsuitable or inadvisable to put into practice, even if theoretically possible. It implies a lack of practicality, common sense or viability in real-world application.

### Distinctions

- Impossible is the strongest term, ruling out any possibility under any conditions.
- Infeasible allows for the theoretical possibility, but renders it unworkable given the present realities.
- Impractical means unwise or unrealistic to attempt, even if not strictly impossible.
- Impossible relates to the inability itself, infeasible relates to limitations making it unachievable, while impractical relates to the inadvisability of the action.

So in essence, impossible means no chance whatsoever, infeasible means currently unworkable given constraints, and impractical means unwise or unrealistic in practice despite theoretical possibility.
## The power of mantras

### you can’t do it

### you can do it

### you will do it
Some leaders demand their subordinates to do the impossible, saying things like *you will do this*. But is this kind of leadership effective? Does it motivate you to work hard if someone forces you to do something? 

### you must do it
