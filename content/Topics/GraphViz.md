## Dot Language
Docs: [DOT Language | Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) 

DOT is a graph description language, developed as a part of the Graphviz project. DOT graphs are typically stored as files with the .gv or .dot filename extension â€” .gv is preferred, to avoid confusion with the .dot extension used by versions of Microsoft Word before 2007. dot is also the name of the main program to process DOT files in the Graphviz package.
