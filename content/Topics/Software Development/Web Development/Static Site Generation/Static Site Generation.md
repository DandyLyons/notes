A Static Site Generator is a tool that compiles all of the pages of a website in advance into simple HTML and CSS. Importantly there is little to no JavaScript, or any other dynamic code. 

**Advantages**: 
- Super fast load times

**Disadvantages:**
- Difficult to implement dynamic features such as search bars. 


## Examples of Static Site Generators
- *Publish* a static site generator written in Swift by John Sundell. 
- [[Hugo/index]] : Javascript, HTML, Go based. 
- [[Topics/Software Development/Web Development/Static Site Generation/Quartz/index|Quartz]] : Obsidian based SSG, built on top of Hugo and Jekyll. 
- Swift [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), (an SSG), [Plot](https://github.com/johnsundell/plot) (an HTML theme engine), and [Ink](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink) (a Markdown parser)
- [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite): Swift based. 
- [[DocC]] is a Swift built in tool to develop documentation. That documentation is technically statically generated HTML. (This isn't traditionally what is thought of when people say static site generation):
	- David Brunow, interestingly proposes using DocC as a blog. See more [here](https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-29-blog-as-documentation).
