### âœ…: How do I make a URL redirect? 
In Obsidian, add an alias to the note. Quartz will read this alias and also create a URL redirect. 

For example if there is a note located at `/Blog/Post.md` and it has the alias `myPermalink` then the url `mysite.com/Blog/myPermalink` will redirect to `mysite.com/Blog/Post`
