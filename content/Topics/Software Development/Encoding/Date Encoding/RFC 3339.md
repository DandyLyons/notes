RFC 3339 is a [[Topics/Software Development/Encoding/Date Encoding/index|Date Encoding]] method.
## RFC 3339 vs ISO 8601
As far as I have found RFC 3339 is mostly the same as [[ISO 8601]], except with a few minor changes:
- RFC 3339 mandates the use of the "T" separator between date and time, while ISO 8601 allows the use of a space.
- RFC 3339 requires 4-digit years, while ISO 8601 allows 2-digit years.
- RFC 3339 only allows a period "." as the decimal separator, while ISO 8601 permits both period and comma.
- RFC 3339 forbids some of the more esoteric formatting options allowed in ISO 8601, like ordinal dates and week dates.
