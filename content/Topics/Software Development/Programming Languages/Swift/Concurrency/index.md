## Paradigms 
Swift supports [[#Language-level concurrency in Swift]], however, it is still early days and inevitably you will encounter prior paradigms of concurrency in Swift. You will need to understand these prior paradigms and how to interoperate between them. 

[[Topics/Software Development/Programming Languages/Swift/Helpful Resources/Pointfree.co/index|pointfree.co]] has a fantastic [series](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/concurrency/threads-queues-and-tasks)[^1] that is a deep-dive on the past, present, and future of concurrency in Swift. 

### Past: Threads
[Episode #190: Concurrency's Past: Threads](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/concurrency/threads-queues-and-tasks/ep190-concurrency-s-past-threads)

### Present: Queues
*Calling Queues the present is a bit relative. We are currently in the middle of a transition so language-level concurrency is becoming the new present.*

### Future: Language-level concurrency in Swift

#### Tasks and Cooperation
