In [[Topics/Software Development/Apple Platforms/WWDC/WWDC '23/index|WWDC '23]], Apple announced a slew of new rules regarding privacy in the App Store. Many of these rules will be enforced starting May 1, 2024. Here I collect my notes on the changes. 

## Terms
- **"Privacy Report"**: The "Privacy Report" is a document generated by Xcode that summarizes the privacy information contained in the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy files used by an app or framework. It provides insights into the privacy settings and permissions defined within the project, aiding developers in ensuring data protection and user privacy[2](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/734971).
- [[`.xcprivacy` files]]
- `.xcframework` files are a way for SDK's to distribute their binaries. Now, they can optionally include a [[`.xcprivacy` files]]. 

## Research
Here, I collect some information resources I have found on the subject:
