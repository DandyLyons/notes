> [!Disambiguation] Playgrounds in Xcode or Playgrounds in the App. 
> Confusingly there are multiple things called a "playground", that have similar use cases but behave differently: 
> - The "[[Swift Playgrounds (app)]]" app made by Apple, available in the App Store. 
> - A [[Playgrounds in Xcode|"Playground" inside of Xcode]]. (This page)
> 
> Unfortunately, many features available in one are not the same in the other.
