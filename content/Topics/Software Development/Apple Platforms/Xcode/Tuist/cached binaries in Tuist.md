One of the biggest reasons why I decided to try Tuist is because it includes the ability to cache your binaries so that you don't need to rebuild your dependencies repeatedly. This can greatly improve build times, especially if you have a very large dependency like [[SwiftSyntax]], which at the moment, every single Macro is required to depend on. 

With v4 Tuist also added the ability to share pre-built binaries to others using [[Tuist Cloud]].
