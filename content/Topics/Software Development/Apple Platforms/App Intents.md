## The Past
In the past, apps could declare functionality to be used by Siri using [[SiriKit]]. To declare functionality to SiriKit, you create a file that defines what actions Siri can tap into. 

Now App Intents allows you to declare the same thing but in actual Swift code. For the most part this is a complete replacement of SiriKit and SiriKit is not necessary unless you are maintaining a legacy declaration declared in SiriKit.
