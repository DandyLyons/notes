- A **hashing algorithm** is used to map data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size have value (or digest). 
- A cryptographic hash function is a specific type of hash function:
	- that is designed to have certain security properties: 
		- it should be computationally infeasible to find collisions (two different inputs that produce the same hash output) and that 
		- the output appears random and unpredictable.
	- a hash function that does not have these qualities is not considered *cryptographically secure*.
