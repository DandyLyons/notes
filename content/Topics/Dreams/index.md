This section is dedicated to dreams. Both the concept of dreams, and the things that I am personally dreaming of.

## My Thoughts on Dreams

Dreams are a funny thing.

We use the word *dreams* to describe that strange thing that happens to us when we sleep. We experience vast new worlds, at times fantastic, yet often non-sensical. 

We also use this word to describe that strange thing that happens to us when we're awake. We dare. Dare to wish. Dare to challenge. Dare to upset the status quo. We who dare are often dismissed as *daydreamers*. This label is both a pejorative and a defense mechanism. The message is clear: though we are awake, really we're asleep. "*Wake up to reality. Be practical.*" This message is not entirely wrong, but it's not entirely right. 

Thank God for dreamers! Every single thing that was ever worth building started with a dream. In the cruel coliseum of reality, the vast majority of these dreams died, but some blessed few lived. Yes, dreams do come true, but so very few. Most die before they are even born, and even most that are will meet the same fate. This is the second reason for the label *daydreamer*: defense. *If I stop dreaming, then I don't have to mourn the death of my failed dreams. But if you dream, then you prove that I gave up on my dreams. And if your dreams succeed, then you prove that I never should have given up.*

To dream is necessary, but it is not enough. Without nourishment, any dream will die on the vine. We must [[Why is this site called "Dream. Build.

To dream is to mourn. Inevitably, most of your dreams will fail. 

But to dream, to truly dream is to [[Hope|hope]].
