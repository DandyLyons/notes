> See, the hard part of Software Engineering is not the code writing. The hard part of Software Engineering is balancing all of the business requirements with all the technical requirements, with all the finance requirements, and figuring out what it is that we need to build in order to be able to get all of those requirements satisfied. Those are really tricky problems, but those problems are all about the people.

> It's a pretty common misconception but it turns out that **making the right decisions about what to program is actually the important part of the job**. Just filling out the lines of code inside the method bodies is the easiest part, the part that AI will be doing soon. It's reasonable that people think that actually typing code is the important part. That's what we think of as "programming." It's most of what schools teach, and it's pretty much the only kind of question that gets asked in interviews these days.
