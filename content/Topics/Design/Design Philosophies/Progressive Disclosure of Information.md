Progressive disclosure of information is a [[Topics/Design/index|Design]] technique used in user interfaces to reduce cognitive load by gradually revealing more complex features or content to users. Initially, only essential options or information are displayed, with more specialized or secondary features hidden until the user requests them. This approach helps balance users' desire for simplicity with the need for powerful and feature-rich interfaces. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps and presenting them one at a time, progressive disclosure aims to reduce user errors, improve learnability, efficiency of use, and lower error rates. It involves categorizing content into primary and secondary levels, with primary content visible upfront and secondary content revealed through interactions like clicking buttons, scrolling, or using tabs and accordions[1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/), [2](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/), [3](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/progressive-disclosure-in-user-interfaces/).
