- [Creating in Tech in 2024 vs. Consuming in Tech in 2024 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp8iVR15Re8) :
	- create? or consume? 
	- We should do both. 
	- >Share what you're working on, something  you're building or making or growing. But also share what you're  absorbing the consumer side. It can be a TV show or a book or a course  or an album or someone's entertaining tweets because that's the stuff that can energize  and inform the very best things we create.
