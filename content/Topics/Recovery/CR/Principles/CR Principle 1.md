### [[CR Step 1]] 

## Principle 1 Prayer
Dear God, Your Word tells me that I can't heal my hurts, hang-ups, and habits by just saying that they are not there. Help me! All of my life is out of my control. I now know that I cannot "fix" myself. It seems the harder that I try to do the right thing, the more I struggle. LORD, I want to step out of my [[Denial]] and into the [[Topics/Truth/index|truth]]. I pray for You to show me [[the way]]. In Your Son's name I pray, Amen. 

## Principle 1 Verses

> [!NOTE] [[Rom-07#v15|Romans 7:15-17]]
> - For I don’t know what I am doing. For I don’t practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.
But if what I don’t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.
So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me. 

- [[2 Cor-01#v9|2 Corinthians 1:9]] 
- [[Jer-06#v14|Jeremiah 6:14]] You can't heal a wound by saying it's not there.
