Thesis, antithesis, and synthesis are a triad of concepts used to describe the dialectical method of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.The key points are:

- Thesis: The initial proposition or idea.
- Antithesis: The negation or contradiction of the thesis.
- Synthesis: A new proposition that reconciles the thesis and antithesis, forming a new idea.

However, the "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" terminology is not actually used by Hegel himself. It originated with other philosophers like Johann Fichte, and is often seen as an oversimplification of Hegel's more complex dialectical method. While the triad can be applied to some of Hegel's ideas, it does not accurately capture the full nuance of his dialectical philosophy. Hegel's own terms like "abstract-dialectical", "positive-negative", and "understanding-critique" better reflect his approach. So in summary, the thesis-antithesis-synthesis model provides a simplified way to understand part of Hegel's dialectical thinking, but it has limitations and should not be seen as a complete representation of his philosophical method.
