Scenius is ==a term coined by musician [[Brian Eno]] to describe the intelligence and intuition of a cultural scene, or the "communal genius"==. It's similar to the idea of [[Genius|genius]], but embedded in a scene rather than in genes. The concept of a "scenius" is similar to collaborative learning and building knowledge.

Here are some famous examples of scenius, communities where people became successful together:
