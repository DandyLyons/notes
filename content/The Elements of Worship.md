Lesson 11
The Church by Jeffrey Johnson

- **How** do we worship? 
	- What are the **elements** of worship? 
		- What does *elements* mean? 
			- The elements of the Lord's Supper are *wine* and *bread*. 
			- Elements are the things that make up something. 
		- God commands us to assemble, gather together
		- Is it okay for us come up with our own elements of worship? To add elements? 
		- There are 6 elements of worship.
			- What all of these have in common is that God told us to do these things. They were no established by mere men. 
			- We should not add or remove from this list. 
			- This is the [[regulative principle of worship]]. 
			- 1. Preaching
				- Worship cannot happen unless God reveals Himself to man. 
				- Thus we need to have God's Word proclaimed to us. 
				- This is fundamental. It is the responsibility of every church. 
				- Martin Lloyd Jones: *The most urgent need of the church is true preaching.*
				- Take a moment to consider, what is the difference between preaching and teaching. 
					- Notice that Jesus did not just teach *about* the truth, but He authoritatively declared it. 
						- He commanded us to *repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is here*. 
						- He commanded the storm to be still. 
						- Furthermore, He empowered and commanded His followers to cast out demons, and bind and loose on earth. 
			- 2. Scripture Reading: 
				- There needs to be a time when the Word is read aloud publicly in the congregation. 
				- Shallow doctrine leads to shallow worship. 
			- 3. Singing 
			- 4. Prayer
			- 5. The Ordinances (The Sacraments)
				- Baptism: 
					- It is our official public confession of faith
				- The Lord's Supper: 
					- 
			- 6. Fellowship
