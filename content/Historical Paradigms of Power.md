1. Those who have power have power
	- strength, armies, material resources, weapons
2. Those who have knowledge have power
	- Yemen had a monopoly on coffee for hundreds of years because they were the only ones that knew how to grow and brew coffee. 
3. Those who have education have power
	- Those who had the most power were those who had the means to acquire an education at an elite school. There they received access to knowledge, information and social networks that were not available to the public. 
4. Those who have expertise have power
	- In the post-internet age, it is close to impossible to hold knowledge that is not available to the public. Practically any piece of information is available to the public, or will soon be available. 
		- Education, government and media have lost their control on what information is and is not publicly available. 
	- While information is publicly available, **knowledge is not**. This is because knowledge is more than merely knowing information. [[#Information and Knowledge are not the same thing]]
	- Experts: In the information age, the most powerful are the experts. These are the people that are best able to acquire information, turn it into knowledge, and then turn that knowledge into action. 
		- Being an expert requires a considerable amount of time and effort. 
5. What will be the new paradigm of power in this next era? 
	- The internet was disruptive because it dramatically lowered the cost, and increased the access to acquiring information. 
		- But even though knowledge no longer costed wealth and social status, knowledge still costed time and effort. Therefore the experts were the ones who were willing and able to put in that time and effort. 
	- LLM's are a new disruptive technology. 
		- Whereas the internet democratized access to information, LLM's appear to democratize access to knowledge.

## Information and Knowledge are not the same thing

One must be able to recall information, decide which information is relevant, filter out false information, and most importantly understand what to do with that information. Only after one has done all of this, have they actually acquired knowledge.
