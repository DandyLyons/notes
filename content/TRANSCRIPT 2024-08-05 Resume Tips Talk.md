*00:00.001 --> 00:05.000*
Okay, that, but you don't really know what that means.

*00:05.000 --> 00:09.000*
And one of the things that I'm here to help you understand is that

*00:09.000 --> 00:12.000*
the resume writing is the skill in on itself.

*00:12.000 --> 00:19.000*
And so if your resume isn't where it needs to be or you want to do, that's okay.

*00:19.000 --> 00:24.000*
The skill, and that's what we here can help you get better at.

*00:24.000 --> 00:29.000*
So kind of the agenda for this presentation is to talk about preparing and customizing it.

*00:29.000 --> 00:34.000*
You can A.I. for resume, or R.A.B.E.S. for developing summary,

*00:34.000 --> 00:38.000*
and then get it raw and custom in your resume.

*00:38.000 --> 00:40.000*
But what is a resume?

*00:40.000 --> 00:44.000*
Most people assume that a resume is piece of paper that gets you a job.

*00:44.000 --> 00:47.000*
That's not necessarily true.

*00:47.000 --> 00:50.000*
What we want you to kind of think about with your resume is that

*00:50.000 --> 00:55.000*
the resume is there and more of these tools can get you into it.

*00:55.000 --> 00:59.000*
And you get the job, it's obviously very much right.

*00:59.000 --> 01:02.000*
So when you're formatting this resume, creating this resume,

*01:02.000 --> 01:06.000*
your goal is to make sure that everything little things you've ever done show up.

*01:06.000 --> 01:08.000*
That's kind of the key.

*01:08.000 --> 01:13.000*
Your goal is to kind of be highlighted and very targeted on the skill set that you have.

*01:13.000 --> 01:17.000*
So that's the employer, the hiring manager, the easy thing to do is, yes,

*01:17.000 --> 01:19.000*
I want to talk to this person.

*01:19.000 --> 01:21.000*
This person has a skill that I'm going to explore.

*01:21.000 --> 01:25.000*
If your resume is too much of a thing, your entire work history,

*01:25.000 --> 01:29.000*
it makes it very hard for them to understand who really is who might,

*01:29.000 --> 01:34.000*
there's a hierarchy that's still down there, right?

*01:34.000 --> 01:38.000*
So, like that, that's the goal that you're creating here.

*01:38.000 --> 01:41.000*
So, again, why customize your resume?

*01:41.000 --> 01:43.000*
You'll hear us talk about that a lot.

*01:43.000 --> 01:45.000*
Customize your resume, tailor your resume.

*01:45.000 --> 01:48.000*
Essentially, that means every job that you apply for,

*01:48.000 --> 01:52.000*
your resume should be changed for the children's job.

*01:52.000 --> 01:55.000*
Now, that sounds like a word because it is worth it.

*01:55.000 --> 01:59.000*
You're applying for 30 jobs and you're making 30 to resume,

*01:59.000 --> 02:01.000*
and that's a lot of time.

*02:01.000 --> 02:05.000*
And you've seen that when you have a resume that is targeted for job A

*02:05.000 --> 02:07.000*
and then that resume then changes for a job B,

*02:07.000 --> 02:13.000*
you're more likely to get that inner to get more opportunity to do the job.

*02:13.000 --> 02:16.000*
You can one of the big things when we talk about that,

*02:16.000 --> 02:20.000*
because I don't know if anybody has heard of active practice systems,

*02:20.000 --> 02:25.000*
or if you have, oh yeah, if you've ever applied for an online,

*02:25.000 --> 02:29.000*
you've gone through that website like Work Today, or anything like that,

*02:29.000 --> 02:31.000*
and they make you submit that resume, and then they go,

*02:31.000 --> 02:34.000*
"All right, now fill out your resume."

*02:34.000 --> 02:36.000*
That's active practice systems.

*02:36.000 --> 02:41.000*
That's essentially AI that has been created and designed to redirect you.

*02:41.000 --> 02:45.000*
And then take a look at the doctor who that employer provided,

*02:45.000 --> 02:49.000*
and almost key word matches against each other,

*02:49.000 --> 02:52.000*
and spit out the word that doesn't match.

*02:52.000 --> 02:55.000*
And that's why customization is so important.

*02:55.000 --> 02:58.000*
If you don't have that revenue customized,

*02:58.000 --> 03:00.000*
you're not going to see that language up there.

*03:00.000 --> 03:03.000*
You think that AI, that ADF, not going to recognize it.

*03:03.000 --> 03:09.000*
We know, as humans, that Excel is a database, and it's a collection, right?

*03:09.000 --> 03:13.000*
But if the employer is definitely somebody who's experienced with data,

*03:13.000 --> 03:16.000*
and you're telling them that you have experienced a scratch,

*03:16.000 --> 03:19.000*
that APS doesn't make that connection.

*03:19.000 --> 03:23.000*
That APS is going, "This person has never worked with scratch in his life."

*03:23.000 --> 03:26.000*
You can make a resume. That's 20 years working with Excel.

*03:26.000 --> 03:30.000*
Pray, but one of those things that we can take a look at,

*03:30.000 --> 03:34.000*
and make small changes on a resume that helps you stand out.

*03:34.000 --> 03:38.000*
So when you're starting this process with your website,

*03:38.000 --> 03:41.000*
starting this process with CUSM,

*03:41.000 --> 03:46.000*
you want to do some research on the language that you want to be in.

*03:46.000 --> 03:52.000*
You can use that job description, and that's primarily the score if I would say CUSM.

*03:52.000 --> 03:56.000*
The language on that job description is the language that they're using.

*03:56.000 --> 04:00.000*
And that, somebody will tap down and load that job description,

*04:00.000 --> 04:02.000*
and they'll load all the work on the script.

*04:02.000 --> 04:04.000*
If you'll resume, you can load all that work on it.

*04:04.000 --> 04:06.000*
It's going to be easier for them to go.

*04:06.000 --> 04:08.000*
Ah, this is the first time we've done that.

*04:08.000 --> 04:15.000*
However, not all jobs for students are robust or bright or consistent.

*04:15.000 --> 04:17.000*
[laughter]

*04:17.000 --> 04:20.000*
You see news, oh, I think you mentioned ONEX earlier.

*04:20.000 --> 04:27.000*
And ONEX is this database that has a bunch of full points

*04:27.000 --> 04:30.000*
on what each job has, and the past that it has,

*04:30.000 --> 04:33.000*
and education requirements for each of it.

*04:33.000 --> 04:36.000*
And I use it a lot to help kind of give you a guide

*04:36.000 --> 04:40.000*
as to what full points past might be,

*04:40.000 --> 04:42.000*
what might you want to put on your application.

*04:42.000 --> 04:47.000*
And that's the thing that almost all of your transition from one through to another

*04:47.000 --> 04:52.000*
to help pull it up and develop what's still kind of like on this job

*04:52.000 --> 04:54.000*
that has a lot to do with the job.

*04:54.000 --> 04:57.000*
There's a great digital game to help kind of get a better understanding

*04:57.000 --> 05:03.000*
rather than just going, what do I think somebody would add to it?

*05:03.000 --> 05:07.000*
Because sometimes we don't get all the time.

*05:07.000 --> 05:10.000*
Another way to do research is to adopt your own consultancy

*05:10.000 --> 05:14.000*
for using employers' websites, see what sort of language they have,

*05:14.000 --> 05:18.000*
what the definition statement, those are the things that are understanding

*05:18.000 --> 05:21.000*
what the employer is looking for as a person.

*05:21.000 --> 05:24.000*
And they can also write and if you can,

*05:24.000 --> 05:29.000*
you can contact them with or connect with them.

*05:29.000 --> 05:31.000*
Also note, if I'm talking to you fast,

*05:31.000 --> 05:33.000*
or if you guys have a question,

*05:33.000 --> 05:35.000*
I'm just going to read it for you.

*05:35.000 --> 05:40.000*
So, when you're using AI for your application,

*05:40.000 --> 05:44.000*
you can use it as a tool to help create that great chat,

*05:44.000 --> 05:49.000*
to be, you know, typing to be, you know,

*05:49.000 --> 05:51.000*
to say, hey, why don't you use two words?

*05:51.000 --> 05:53.000*
I think you can use them for a little bit more detail.

*05:53.000 --> 05:56.000*
You know, spit it out, there's an amount of information,

*05:56.000 --> 05:59.000*
but you can use that as a tool for thinking,

*05:59.000 --> 06:01.000*
please use AI for your help,

*06:01.000 --> 06:03.000*
and you can work that out.

*06:03.000 --> 06:05.000*
We all know that, right?

*06:05.000 --> 06:07.000*
We don't want, I say we're writing the papers through AI,

*06:07.000 --> 06:10.000*
we don't want to be writing our resume through AI.

*06:10.000 --> 06:13.000*
We know that the way to chat that information is wrong.

*06:13.000 --> 06:16.000*
That's when you generally learn your own words.

*06:16.000 --> 06:18.000*
Make sure that you are filling up these words.

*06:18.000 --> 06:19.000*
It's not a problem.

*06:19.000 --> 06:21.000*
They're not going to see what's wrong.

*06:21.000 --> 06:24.000*
We use AI for our type things,

*06:24.000 --> 06:26.000*
and we can chat with people.

*06:26.000 --> 06:28.000*
We can see a better idea on these things,

*06:28.000 --> 06:31.000*
whether they're just foreign, that sort of thing, again.

*06:31.000 --> 06:33.000*
Don't use this as your own,

*06:33.000 --> 06:36.000*
because that's a tool to help you kind of get started.

*06:36.000 --> 06:38.000*
If you're worried about how to write a name,

*06:38.000 --> 06:40.000*
you're worried about your resume.

*06:40.000 --> 06:42.000*
That's the first thing you need to do.

*06:42.000 --> 06:44.000*
Anybody first can get a job.

*06:44.000 --> 06:49.000*
One way to do that is to put your results in,

*06:49.000 --> 06:52.000*
get a capital X, so that can guarantee

*06:52.000 --> 06:55.000*
you are absolutely right in your writing.

*06:55.000 --> 06:57.000*
You can do that on your own.

*06:57.000 --> 07:00.000*
You can give it to the user.

*07:00.000 --> 07:02.000*
Without a problem.

*07:02.000 --> 07:05.000*
After writing, you're going to have to go through your resume.

*07:05.000 --> 07:09.000*
You can do that first and get the return.

*07:09.000 --> 07:11.000*
It's going to tell you.

*07:11.000 --> 07:14.000*
It's the same with the resume.

*07:14.000 --> 07:17.000*
Really, I don't think that much,

*07:17.000 --> 07:21.000*
but I know what it's like.

*07:21.000 --> 07:23.000*
So, resume closet.

*07:23.000 --> 07:25.000*
So, as we're building this resume,

*07:25.000 --> 07:27.000*
as we're doing our research,

*07:27.000 --> 07:31.000*
if I get an idea of where we want our resume to start,

*07:31.000 --> 07:34.000*
you might come up with thousands of books.

*07:34.000 --> 07:36.000*
Here all the time,

*07:36.000 --> 07:39.000*
if you're your resume is not 28 pages long,

*07:39.000 --> 07:41.000*
you want it to be more than 28, right?

*07:41.000 --> 07:43.000*
You're starting to create this resume pathway.

*07:43.000 --> 07:46.000*
I put this resume closet.

*07:46.000 --> 07:48.000*
You're building that to the full point.

*07:48.000 --> 07:50.000*
You can think about whether you're getting a job.

*07:50.000 --> 07:52.000*
How do you start writing that?

*07:52.000 --> 07:55.000*
We're documenting an evil doc,

*07:55.000 --> 07:57.000*
a paper, a powerhouse.

*07:57.000 --> 07:59.000*
Write down everything that you saw.

*07:59.000 --> 08:01.000*
All the past, what are the other resumes?

*08:01.000 --> 08:03.000*
Is it relevant or are they not?

*08:03.000 --> 08:06.000*
That way, we create the perfect quality.

*08:06.000 --> 08:08.000*
The ones that you type in.

*08:08.000 --> 08:09.000*
That way, people go to the team,

*08:09.000 --> 08:11.000*
write the product,

*08:11.000 --> 08:13.000*
and pull out the past.

*08:13.000 --> 08:17.000*
And we can have jobs or retail sales.

*08:17.000 --> 08:21.000*
You might have some IT before type of fear,

*08:21.000 --> 08:24.000*
but they're not going to care about that IT past.

*08:24.000 --> 08:26.000*
We're going to leave that in the resume closet

*08:26.000 --> 08:29.000*
and customize your resume to that retail sale.

*08:29.000 --> 08:31.000*
We're going to have to apply that IT bill

*08:31.000 --> 08:34.000*
that you want to take off that resume or retail hat.

*08:34.000 --> 08:36.000*
We're going to pull out that IT hat

*08:36.000 --> 08:39.000*
and we'll customize your resume to that.

*08:39.000 --> 08:44.000*
We're going to start with the kind of headboard.

*08:44.000 --> 08:47.000*
So, we'll do our kid.

*08:47.000 --> 08:50.000*
Blue resume here.

*08:50.000 --> 08:55.000*
This is a doc script for a night wearout load.

*08:55.000 --> 08:59.000*
We'll want to get to maybe a minute or two.

*08:59.000 --> 09:03.000*
We're trying to get an idea of what important work

*09:03.000 --> 09:06.000*
we're looking for with this doc script.

*09:06.000 --> 09:10.000*
Go ahead, write things down if you want.

*09:10.000 --> 09:12.000*
Zone out.

*09:12.000 --> 09:14.000*
I don't care.

*09:14.000 --> 09:16.000*
I'm not your teacher.

*09:16.000 --> 09:18.000*
Is it for a break?

*09:18.000 --> 09:21.000*
Can you tell Susan to use a bigger font next time?

*09:21.000 --> 09:24.000*
[laughter]

*09:24.000 --> 09:36.000*
Alright, so what have we seen?

*09:36.000 --> 09:39.000*
Entry level position.

*09:39.000 --> 09:43.000*
We're going to be able to lift up to 60 pounds.

*09:43.000 --> 09:46.000*
We're going to be on the feet all day.

*09:46.000 --> 09:52.000*
You're going to have to have a car.

*09:52.000 --> 09:56.000*
Even though it's probably illegal to have that.

*09:56.000 --> 10:01.000*
You have to ask, do you have the ability to work?

*10:03.000 --> 10:06.000*
There's three running out there who can make shift.

*10:06.000 --> 10:09.000*
Four of them might not be popular.

*10:09.000 --> 10:12.000*
We've got to have some form of direct communication.

*10:12.000 --> 10:14.000*
What?

*10:17.000 --> 10:19.000*
Forklift?

*10:19.000 --> 10:25.000*
So, kind of get a general idea of what night wearout loader is.

*10:25.000 --> 10:29.000*
Now, we've got two different resumes.

*10:29.000 --> 10:34.000*
We're going to take a look at which resume you would want to interpret.

*10:34.000 --> 10:37.000*
Here's the resume one.

*10:37.000 --> 10:39.000*
Here's the game.

*10:39.000 --> 10:44.000*
Here's the second page.

*10:44.000 --> 10:50.000*
Now, that was very quick, right?

*10:50.000 --> 10:54.000*
Hiring managers, ten to take.

*10:54.000 --> 10:56.000*
Five seconds.

*10:56.000 --> 10:59.000*
Maybe for a second to look at it.

*10:59.000 --> 11:01.000*
That's kind of what you just did there.

*11:01.000 --> 11:04.000*
Did you see anything you liked about it?

*11:04.000 --> 11:05.000*
Ranch worker.

*11:05.000 --> 11:08.000*
He's got a strong back and willing to do hard work.

*11:08.000 --> 11:09.000*
Yeah, mom.

*11:09.000 --> 11:10.000*
Same thing I saw.

*11:10.000 --> 11:11.000*
Cool.

*11:11.000 --> 11:13.000*
And we're going to look at another one.

*11:13.000 --> 11:17.000*
So that move, that start.

*11:17.000 --> 11:20.000*
Now, if you're looking at 60 pounds.

*11:20.000 --> 11:21.000*
Dude.

*11:21.000 --> 11:22.000*
But did you see anything?

*11:22.000 --> 11:23.000*
Not really.

*11:23.000 --> 11:24.000*
No.

*11:24.000 --> 11:30.000*
Bullet points that applied to the job quickly.

*11:30.000 --> 11:31.000*
Yeah.

*11:31.000 --> 11:35.000*
So which resume would you say qualified me above those five seconds?

*11:35.000 --> 11:36.000*
Second one.

*11:37.000 --> 11:38.000*
Right?

*11:38.000 --> 11:42.000*
Because you were really able to see right away,

*11:42.000 --> 11:45.000*
both, both quick,

*11:45.000 --> 11:50.000*
all the changes that you take a long time to look at it.

*11:50.000 --> 11:53.000*
You can see labor, labor, production.

*11:53.000 --> 11:59.000*
But harder to pull out that ability to lift if you have that warehouse experience.

*11:59.000 --> 12:00.000*
That's what it's saying.

*12:00.000 --> 12:03.000*
This person is probably very well-off on what he's got.

*12:03.000 --> 12:05.000*
And this person will not get the interview.

*12:05.000 --> 12:08.000*
Because Jennifer, or Samantha, who's got a resume,

*12:08.000 --> 12:10.000*
is right through the point.

*12:10.000 --> 12:12.000*
It's the head blind there.

*12:12.000 --> 12:13.000*
Right?

*12:13.000 --> 12:16.000*
And if you see a bobcat hopped out,

*12:16.000 --> 12:18.000*
it's a cool compound.

*12:18.000 --> 12:21.000*
And that's what we're trying to connect with the product,

*12:21.000 --> 12:23.000*
the format of the resume.

*12:23.000 --> 12:25.000*
And maybe Jennifer and I, again,

*12:25.000 --> 12:28.000*
overlooking our resume with everything,

*12:28.000 --> 12:31.000*
will be in the garbage.

*12:31.000 --> 12:37.000*
I'm going to kind of skip this.

*12:37.000 --> 12:40.000*
This is just general formatting and that sort of thing.

*12:40.000 --> 12:42.000*
We'll come back to that.

*12:42.000 --> 12:46.000*
But the big element of your resume is that you don't want to make sure that you have

*12:46.000 --> 12:49.000*
the same contact information,

*12:49.000 --> 12:52.000*
the title of the target solution for applying for,

*12:52.000 --> 12:55.000*
similar conversations in your work experience,

*12:55.000 --> 12:58.000*
and it's audited.

*12:58.000 --> 13:02.000*
Name and contact information.

*13:02.000 --> 13:04.000*
Very quick.

*13:04.000 --> 13:08.000*
You probably want to make sure that you don't need to label your phone,

*13:08.000 --> 13:10.000*
you don't need to label your email.

*13:10.000 --> 13:12.000*
You put it on one line to help save it.

*13:12.000 --> 13:15.000*
It's just there to provide information.

*13:15.000 --> 13:17.000*
James had a lot of information on that.

*13:17.000 --> 13:19.000*
That's not a fact.

*13:19.000 --> 13:22.000*
He had a full-smooth address, which is not that good.

*13:22.000 --> 13:26.000*
He labeled both phone and label, which is also the one that's there.

*13:26.000 --> 13:28.000*
We just need the one phone.

*13:28.000 --> 13:30.000*
During the one phone, the number of the email.

*13:30.000 --> 13:32.000*
Now you're going to answer.

*13:32.000 --> 13:34.000*
And you notice also,

*13:34.000 --> 13:39.000*
"Microwave Eli," that email does not work.

*13:39.000 --> 13:44.000*
It's a good email, but it's not a professional email.

*13:44.000 --> 13:47.000*
Sam Jay at the email.

*13:47.000 --> 13:50.000*
And the small, big things like that.

*13:50.000 --> 13:53.000*
If you have a bite of a 55 email,

*13:53.000 --> 13:58.000*
you can create a second email that's a little more appropriate,

*13:58.000 --> 14:00.000*
a little more professional.

*14:00.000 --> 14:03.000*
I worked with a few years ago

*14:03.000 --> 14:05.000*
for the email of like,

*14:05.000 --> 14:08.000*
"DarcyCat 04" or something like that.

*14:08.000 --> 14:12.000*
And you know how you can choose your name in that email.

*14:12.000 --> 14:15.000*
And the name signature literally was the "Shadow."

*14:15.000 --> 14:17.000*
And I was like, "KJ."

*14:17.000 --> 14:20.000*
[laughter]

*14:20.000 --> 14:22.000*
I can show you.

*14:22.000 --> 14:24.000*
This is an email, a Gmail email.

*14:24.000 --> 14:27.000*
I can see what your name and your email are now in the chat.

*14:27.000 --> 14:30.000*
And you can send me an email back to this email

*14:30.000 --> 14:32.000*
the very next day from Dave.

*14:32.000 --> 14:33.000*
[laughter]

*14:33.000 --> 14:34.000*
He's adding my thoughts.

*14:34.000 --> 14:39.000*
Do you have that email from when you were 13?

*14:39.000 --> 14:41.000*
I don't like it.

*14:41.000 --> 14:43.000*
It wasn't as cool as the "Shadow,"

*14:43.000 --> 14:44.000*
but I love it.

*14:44.000 --> 14:47.000*
[laughter]

*14:47.000 --> 14:49.000*
So, the next part, after we get that name

*14:49.000 --> 14:51.000*
and that contact information all set up,

*14:51.000 --> 14:53.000*
name it that target position.

*14:53.000 --> 14:56.000*
It's interesting, but again, that APS

*14:56.000 --> 14:59.000*
is doing that word matching and that's what it says.

*14:59.000 --> 15:01.000*
You click exactly the job title

*15:01.000 --> 15:04.000*
that you're applying for on your resume.

*15:04.000 --> 15:06.000*
Checkmark right there for that APS.

*15:06.000 --> 15:09.000*
So if it's "Worthouse Specialist 3"

*15:09.000 --> 15:11.000*
you click "Worthouse Specialist 3"

*15:11.000 --> 15:14.000*
to make those changes every time.

*15:14.000 --> 15:16.000*
Next, honestly, you need one change

*15:16.000 --> 15:18.000*
you make on all your resumes.

*15:18.000 --> 15:20.000*
You just can't feel like your resume is customized enough

*15:20.000 --> 15:21.000*
for a job.

*15:21.000 --> 15:23.000*
"Worthouse Specialist 3"

*15:23.000 --> 15:25.000*
"Nightmare House Loader 4"

*15:25.000 --> 15:27.000*
"Warehouse Warranty"

*15:27.000 --> 15:29.000*
"Wake Alert"

*15:29.000 --> 15:32.000*
The next section is a summary of the fall vacation.

*15:32.000 --> 15:36.000*
And this is going to be that beginning section right here.

*15:36.000 --> 15:40.000*
A lot of people on their resumes have objective statements

*15:40.000 --> 15:43.000*
or skill sections and that sort of stuff.

*15:43.000 --> 15:45.000*
And those work all fine.

*15:45.000 --> 15:50.000*
What we like to do is to start with this one section.

*15:50.000 --> 15:52.000*
It has three to six bullet points that kind of

*15:52.000 --> 15:54.000*
actually look cool.

*15:54.000 --> 15:57.000*
That's high-free employment.

*15:57.000 --> 16:00.000*
Make it really easy for the readers to understand

*16:00.000 --> 16:02.000*
exactly what your skills are.

*16:02.000 --> 16:06.000*
So on that job description, we'll first fill.

*16:06.000 --> 16:09.000*
We can kind of use the "first fill" section

*16:09.000 --> 16:11.000*
as your word, "summer section" or "older".

*16:11.000 --> 16:14.000*
Make sure those summary sections are both on the chart.

*16:14.000 --> 16:16.000*
Meaning on all the people that they want.

*16:16.000 --> 16:19.000*
So you order most of that to be in the section.

*16:19.000 --> 16:22.000*
The only group that's in the name is in the summary section.

*16:22.000 --> 16:24.000*
Would they be able to say yes or no

*16:24.000 --> 16:26.000*
if the person is in the team?

*16:26.000 --> 16:28.000*
That's the tension that they're going to be using.

*16:28.000 --> 16:36.000*
So things like measurable skills.

*16:36.000 --> 16:42.000*
So five years of experience in utilizing accountants' software.

*16:42.000 --> 16:44.000*
Excellent communication skills.

*16:44.000 --> 16:45.000*
Both written and urban.

*16:45.000 --> 16:47.000*
Able to live with your family.

*16:47.000 --> 16:49.000*
All those things that are very general

*16:49.000 --> 16:53.000*
that we'll talk about in the area of the team experience.

*16:53.000 --> 16:56.000*
I think that we can quantify it right away.

*16:56.000 --> 16:59.000*
But if that job is applicable to you in your experience,

*16:59.000 --> 17:02.000*
just spread out talent at your financial level.

*17:02.000 --> 17:05.000*
Like the checkbox, the possible employment,

*17:05.000 --> 17:06.000*
and the employer.

*17:06.000 --> 17:08.000*
Now, if there is one coming here,

*17:08.000 --> 17:10.000*
if it personally do that,

*17:10.000 --> 17:13.000*
then it will be possible to make that help.

*17:13.000 --> 17:17.000*
That summary section is very important.

*17:17.000 --> 17:21.000*
Also, think about what people compliment your ability to offer.

*17:21.000 --> 17:23.000*
You're a very friendly person.

*17:23.000 --> 17:24.000*
You're very outgoing person.

*17:24.000 --> 17:26.000*
You're a very good meter.

*17:26.000 --> 17:28.000*
Excellent communicator.

*17:28.000 --> 17:31.000*
What do you ask about advice for?

*17:31.000 --> 17:34.000*
Use skills that you're important or are looking for.

*17:34.000 --> 17:36.000*
And again, that's where OMAC is kind of helping

*17:36.000 --> 17:38.000*
kind of get the idea.

*17:38.000 --> 17:40.000*
Especially for moving from Indian to the street.

*17:40.000 --> 17:42.000*
Have you ever worked in before?

*17:42.000 --> 17:44.000*
Using OMAC, even as an object,

*17:44.000 --> 17:48.000*
you're probably identified one person who's still in the team.

*17:48.000 --> 17:50.000*
So here we are again.

*17:50.000 --> 17:53.000*
Two years of back-to-age health experience.

*17:53.000 --> 17:55.000*
And as a person who does that,

*17:55.000 --> 17:58.000*
reliable artwork professional who is working

*17:58.000 --> 18:00.000*
individually and on a team,

*18:00.000 --> 18:03.000*
he counts, but will out of his workflow,

*18:03.000 --> 18:06.000*
I feel like this person without the right,

*18:06.000 --> 18:09.000*
the entire revenue, I want to talk to you about.

*18:09.000 --> 18:10.000*
Right?

*18:10.000 --> 18:11.000*
So, definitely that.

*18:11.000 --> 18:12.000*
But,

*18:22.000 --> 18:24.000*
another example,

*18:24.000 --> 18:51.000*
we focused on soft skills for skilled developers.

*18:51.000 --> 18:53.000*
Soft skills are still available.

*18:53.000 --> 18:54.000*
Good question.

*18:54.000 --> 18:58.000*
In that final inspection,

*18:58.000 --> 19:00.000*
it's great for a lot of these soft skills

*19:00.000 --> 19:05.000*
that are harder to talk about in your job experience.

*19:05.000 --> 19:07.000*
And after that,

*19:07.000 --> 19:09.000*
the little soft skills are where you

*19:09.000 --> 19:12.000*
have problems with that.

*19:12.000 --> 19:13.000*
For you,

*19:13.000 --> 19:15.000*
I think that makes sense.

*19:15.000 --> 19:16.000*
Thank you.

*19:16.000 --> 19:18.000*
And for you.

*19:20.000 --> 19:23.000*
For the job that I just landed,

*19:23.000 --> 19:29.000*
the reason why they selected me

*19:29.000 --> 19:34.000*
was because I was more in the position

*19:34.000 --> 19:37.000*
that they were asking for,

*19:37.000 --> 19:40.000*
even though the price range was about right.

*19:40.000 --> 19:44.000*
I was more on the higher end of that price range.

*19:46.000 --> 19:51.000*
Yes, it took two months for them to get back to me.

*19:51.000 --> 19:53.000*
However,

*19:53.000 --> 19:56.000*
what I'm gathering in all this,

*19:56.000 --> 19:59.000*
do you want to read out your

*19:59.000 --> 20:03.000*
non-existing bullet points off of it

*20:03.000 --> 20:07.000*
when you're answering to each one,

*20:07.000 --> 20:09.000*
or do you want to leave it in?

*20:09.000 --> 20:14.000*
If this is a position that is a lot lower than you,

*20:15.000 --> 20:19.000*
do you want to take away all that experience

*20:19.000 --> 20:24.000*
so that could lead to a better position with that company?

*20:24.000 --> 20:25.000*
Yeah.

*20:25.000 --> 20:28.000*
So that's one question right now.

*20:28.000 --> 20:30.000*
Yes, no, and that's a good question.

*20:30.000 --> 20:34.000*
When you're reading out for information on your resume,

*20:34.000 --> 20:36.000*
you're kind of using it as a

*20:36.000 --> 20:40.000*
what should I think is relevant to your position,

*20:40.000 --> 20:44.000*
to what you think they might be looking for in your position.

*20:44.000 --> 20:47.000*
If your point or an entry-level position,

*20:47.000 --> 20:49.000*
and you have PhD and a master's,

*20:49.000 --> 20:51.000*
and 25 years of experience in your point

*20:51.000 --> 20:52.000*
or in your position,

*20:52.000 --> 20:54.000*
that's definitely not your point.

*20:54.000 --> 20:56.000*
They don't want to talk to that person

*20:56.000 --> 20:57.000*
for an entry-level position.

*20:57.000 --> 20:59.000*
That resume might be a good support for that person.

*20:59.000 --> 21:03.000*
However, moving that movement up to a higher point,

*21:03.000 --> 21:05.000*
if you have that 25 years,

*21:05.000 --> 21:07.000*
if you have all that high spirit,

*21:07.000 --> 21:08.000*
that's okay.

*21:08.000 --> 21:10.000*
Yeah, but you can't gauge us to

*21:10.000 --> 21:14.000*
what an employer is, right?

*21:14.000 --> 21:17.000*
So it's not a bad thing to read out for information,

*21:17.000 --> 21:20.000*
and it's not that thing to do to serve information.

*21:20.000 --> 21:22.000*
It really is a great answer,

*21:22.000 --> 21:24.000*
because a company's lawyer is more of an information.

*21:24.000 --> 21:28.000*
Some employers can get it without any experience.

*21:28.000 --> 21:30.000*
Also, experience, because they think,

*21:30.000 --> 21:33.000*
ah, this person is a point or stop,

*21:33.000 --> 21:34.000*
because he doesn't need a stop

*21:34.000 --> 21:37.000*
when it comes to that person's point of view.

*21:37.000 --> 21:40.000*
It's not your point.

*21:40.000 --> 21:43.000*
Not your point.

*21:43.000 --> 21:47.000*
Okay, good.

*21:47.000 --> 21:51.000*
Oh, would it be reasonable to use

*21:51.000 --> 21:53.000*
how early the experience is going to be

*21:53.000 --> 21:57.000*
defined for a job that is technically more

*21:57.000 --> 21:59.000*
living than it has to be for?

*21:59.000 --> 22:03.000*
Keeping the fact that you can be experienced

*22:03.000 --> 22:06.000*
without elaborating on how much of that experience is going to be.

*22:06.000 --> 22:09.000*
I have experience using it,

*22:09.000 --> 22:13.000*
so I'm saying I have 25 years of experience.

*22:13.000 --> 22:15.000*
Yeah, would that be a good compromise?

*22:15.000 --> 22:18.000*
Yeah, that's a great technique that we're going to be able to graduate.

*22:18.000 --> 22:21.000*
We know job's trip is going to be a big step,

*22:21.000 --> 22:23.000*
so we want five years of experience,

*22:23.000 --> 22:24.000*
two years of experience,

*22:24.000 --> 22:26.000*
oh, exactly that number.

*22:26.000 --> 22:28.000*
Two plus years of experience.

*22:28.000 --> 22:30.000*
Two plus years of experience,

*22:30.000 --> 22:31.000*
three plus five years.

*22:31.000 --> 22:33.000*
That's what you're getting on,

*22:33.000 --> 22:38.000*
what they're asking for without alluding to all these other years of experience.

*22:38.000 --> 22:40.000*
That is like a good thing.

*22:40.000 --> 22:45.000*
On that note also, I did hear a lot about age and all that sort of stuff.

*22:45.000 --> 22:47.000*
That word on the resume,

*22:47.000 --> 22:49.000*
we do have a wonderful workshop tomorrow,

*22:49.000 --> 22:52.000*
virtual, with the workforce center,

*22:52.000 --> 22:55.000*
about job 13 after 15,

*22:55.000 --> 22:58.000*
but after 15,

*22:58.000 --> 23:02.000*
stuff does do a great work on talking about

*23:02.000 --> 23:04.000*
the workforce, not just the resume,

*23:04.000 --> 23:06.000*
but the people in the workforce,

*23:06.000 --> 23:12.000*
talking about themselves without worrying about what they did with their work.

*23:12.000 --> 23:15.000*
Just a plug there, I'm not running that.

*23:15.000 --> 23:20.000*
Can we get that information on the virtual from you?

*23:20.000 --> 23:21.000*
Yeah.

*23:21.000 --> 23:24.000*
Okay, my question was for Megan, who's your coworker.

*23:24.000 --> 23:25.000*
Yeah.

*23:25.000 --> 23:28.000*
She said, because I have all that deep experience

*23:28.000 --> 23:31.000*
and I had the original, horrible,

*23:31.000 --> 23:33.000*
that could have been my resume there.

*23:33.000 --> 23:35.000*
It was a book.

*23:35.000 --> 23:37.000*
She said, I went to the bullet points

*23:37.000 --> 23:39.000*
and then I started getting interviews.

*23:39.000 --> 23:42.000*
She said, take that deep knowledge,

*23:42.000 --> 23:48.000*
project experience and team lead and that kind of thing.

*23:48.000 --> 23:50.000*
Put it on your LinkedIn.

*23:50.000 --> 23:55.000*
Move all that detail of your LinkedIn in describing yourself.

*23:55.000 --> 23:57.000*
I like that, yeah.

*23:57.000 --> 23:59.000*
That's great.

*23:59.000 --> 24:03.000*
Remember, again, the goal of the resume is to get the interview,

*24:03.000 --> 24:06.000*
is all that information that gets you in the interview.

*24:06.000 --> 24:10.000*
You're something that I won't look at after the day out.

*24:10.000 --> 24:13.000*
Yeah, I was just going to follow up on what Dana said.

*24:13.000 --> 24:17.000*
I like what Gabe said about if they asked for two years of Excel experience,

*24:17.000 --> 24:21.000*
maybe five, put two plus or maybe five plus.

*24:21.000 --> 24:24.000*
What you don't want to do is completely misrepresent yourself.

*24:24.000 --> 24:26.000*
Then when you show up at the interview,

*24:26.000 --> 24:29.000*
this guy was completely disengaged in his resume,

*24:29.000 --> 24:32.000*
that's not going to get you in trouble.

*24:32.000 --> 24:36.000*
You'll definitely get the ex-out of the interview process.

*24:36.000 --> 24:41.000*
So be honest yet, as Gabe said, tailor it.

*24:41.000 --> 24:44.000*
And like Paul said, a little bit after,

*24:44.000 --> 24:47.000*
one step up, two steps up is probably a good thing.

*24:47.000 --> 24:49.000*
It's not a bad thing.

*24:49.000 --> 24:53.000*
Five, six steps.

*24:53.000 --> 24:58.000*
If you have a PhD in geoscience

*24:58.000 --> 25:02.000*
and you're applying for a work at Cinnamarck,

*25:02.000 --> 25:04.000*
do you think they're going to hire you?

*25:04.000 --> 25:06.000*
No, I think they're going to hire you.

*25:06.000 --> 25:08.000*
And I think that's what we do a lot of people who come here

*25:08.000 --> 25:10.000*
to get a job in the college.

*25:10.000 --> 25:12.000*
Because the college is not in the time to talk to you.

*25:12.000 --> 25:14.000*
They're not the audience.

*25:14.000 --> 25:16.000*
The college is not the entire.

*25:16.000 --> 25:20.000*
Be the person they want about the college.

*25:20.000 --> 25:24.000*
Question?

*25:24.000 --> 25:28.000*
Given that it'll be read by ATS,

*25:28.000 --> 25:30.000*
when I submit a resume,

*25:30.000 --> 25:33.000*
are there certain incompatibility things

*25:33.000 --> 25:37.000*
that the ATS just might not handle like file formats?

*25:37.000 --> 25:39.000*
Yeah, good question.

*25:39.000 --> 25:42.000*
You kind of want to submit it at either as a JPEG,

*25:42.000 --> 25:44.000*
not as an image.

*25:44.000 --> 25:47.000*
You want to submit it as a PDF or Word documents.

*25:47.000 --> 25:50.000*
I like this PDF because it maintains

*25:50.000 --> 25:53.000*
all your formatting options and that sort of thing.

*25:53.000 --> 25:55.000*
But another big thing that you don't want to do

*25:55.000 --> 25:58.000*
on your resume is use things like

*25:58.000 --> 26:03.000*
picture, text boxes, shapes, images,

*26:03.000 --> 26:05.000*
tables, tables.

*26:05.000 --> 26:06.000*
Tables.

*26:06.000 --> 26:07.000*
We all do it.

*26:07.000 --> 26:09.000*
Because it's our own table stuff.

*26:09.000 --> 26:12.000*
And the reasoning why is because

*26:12.000 --> 26:16.000*
the ATS is trying to read it straight up at just that.

*26:16.000 --> 26:19.000*
And the more formatting options that you give it to try to have

*26:19.000 --> 26:21.000*
in that data world, the more likely it is

*26:21.000 --> 26:24.000*
to just not communicate it to my audience.

*26:24.000 --> 26:27.000*
That scene calls, I think, very nice presentation.

*26:27.000 --> 26:30.000*
That have the shapes that have called tables

*26:30.000 --> 26:32.000*
all that stuff that for humans,

*26:32.000 --> 26:34.000*
it really eases that guess.

*26:34.000 --> 26:36.000*
Which would be like that, I don't know,

*26:36.000 --> 26:39.000*
that was your name that was given.

*26:39.000 --> 26:41.000*
So you're allowed to have that in my circle.

*26:41.000 --> 26:45.000*
In fact, I encourage you as a one that can,

*26:45.000 --> 26:47.000*
that can be answered.

*26:47.000 --> 26:50.000*
So you're saluted online and you forward it.

*26:50.000 --> 26:52.000*
It's going to look forward.

*26:52.000 --> 26:55.000*
You don't have to be one better.

*26:55.000 --> 26:57.000*
But here, the parallel.

*26:57.000 --> 27:00.000*
Here, you have a balance.

*27:00.000 --> 27:02.000*
If now, usually, there's a choice.

*27:02.000 --> 27:05.000*
Do you want this to be used by AI or not?

*27:09.000 --> 27:11.000*
I can first.

*48:21.000 --> 48:26.000*
[LAUGHTER]

*49:51.000 --> 49:56.000*
[APPLAUSE]
